      PREFATORY NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n this story I
      have touched, very feebly and inadequately, on one of the greatest and
      saddest of human problems&mdash;as great and sad, certainly, as the
      problem which forms the central purpose of my &lsquo;Shadow of the Sword.&rsquo; What
      the creed of Peace is to the state, the creed of Purity is to the social
      community. So long as carnal indulgence is recognised as a masculine
      prerogative, so long as personal chastity is a supreme factor in the fate
      of women, but a mere accident in the lives of men, so long as the diabolic
      ingenuity of a strong sex is tortured to devise legal means for
      sacrificing a weaker sex&mdash;so long, in a word, as our homes and our
      streets remain what they are&mdash;the creed of Purity must remain as
      forlorn a dream as that other creed of Peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more with regard to my <i>dramatis persono</i>, none of whom are
      to be taken for photographs or caricatures of living individuals. In one
      case I have endeavoured to construct out of the editorial chit-chat of a
      journal an amusing personality,&mdash;not, I think, ungenerously
      conceived; of the real editor I know absolutely nothing, and I certainly
      bear him no ill-will, much as I dislike the system of personal journalism
      which he has created. All the other characters are purely fictitious.
      Gavrolles and his circle are to be accepted as representatives, not of
      æstheticism proper, but of the cant of æstheticism&mdash;which is quite
      another thing.

    <h2>
      PROLOGUE IN THE NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the two women
      gazed at one another under the lamplight, one standing and looking down,
      the other sitting and looking up, you would have said they might have been
      twin sisters&mdash;they looked so wonderfully alike. Both were fair, with
      pale forget-me-not eyes, and skins delicately clear; both were tall and
      slight. Nor was there any very noticeable difference in the dress they
      wore. She who stood erect, with the rain beating down upon her head, wore
      only, besides her bonnet and dress of black stuff, a shawl wrapt tightly
      around her; the shawl was rich and valuable, but looked common enough in
      the dim light. She who sat, with her elbow on her knees and her chin
      resting in her open palms, wore a shawl too, and a plain stuff dress,
      sodden with the rain; her bonnet had fallen back, soaking and unheeded, on
      her shoulders, just held by the sodden strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A close observer, however, would have perceived a world of difference
      between these two women. The woman standing had the fierce, pained,
      impatient manner of a wild animal; every look, every gesture was
      self-contained, determined, yet full of overmastering anxiety, The woman
      sitting was a crushed, gin-sodden, passionless, powerless waif, with only
      the courage of a hunted pariah dog, to snap, and crawl uselessly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were very young, neither being more than twenty-one or twenty-two
      years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That way!&mdash;over the Bridge!&rsquo; said the woman sitting, in a husky
      voice; then she added, as the other seemed about to pass on, &lsquo;Stop though!
      what are you going to stand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other turned quickly, and again looked down with her large eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&mdash;Money?&rsquo; The voice was deep and clear, though it
      trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m as thirsty as a fish. Lend me a shilling, and I&rsquo;ll pay you back
      some night when I&rsquo;m in luck. Only a shilling! that won&rsquo;t break you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I give you the money, what will you do with it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drink it,&rsquo; was the curt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the answer had a curious effect on the hearer. She stooped
      softly down and looked earnestly in the other woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll know me again when you see me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Do you mind telling me your
      name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ellen,&mdash;never mind what else. Nell for snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anywhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old are you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord knows. Twenty or thereabouts. Are you going to keep on questioning
      all the blessed night? I want something to drink.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who stood bent over the sitting girl and placed something in her
      hand. She uttered a suppressed cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gold! Why, you&rsquo;ve given me a sovereign! What for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have only another, or I would give you more. I am sorry for you. Good
      night!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop! don&rsquo;t go. Let me have another look at you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a fool I was! Why you&rsquo;re <i>a lady!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the other&rsquo;s turn to laugh now&mdash;a low, bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve got on a real Injy shawl&mdash;let me feel it! And there&rsquo;s a
      pair of gold bracelets on your wrists! Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;!!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This with a prolonged half whistle, expressive of utter surprise. Then she
      continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, or where you&rsquo;re a-going, but the streets ain&rsquo;t
      safe for the likes of <i>you</i>. You&rsquo;d best go home, my lady!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What home I had I have left, never to go back. I am leaving London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anywhere.&rsquo; After a moment&rsquo;s pause she pointed across the river and over
      the house-tops, and added, &lsquo;Out there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends there, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And not much coin. Ah, well, you&rsquo;ve them swell bracelets; and the shawl,
      too, is worth money.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very strange&mdash;innocent as the remark seemed, it appeared to
      make the tall figure of the listener tremble with agitation, perhaps with
      anger. With a quick impetuous movement she drew off her bracelets and
      threw them into the girl&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take them&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want them! And the shawl too&mdash;take
      it, and give me yours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re joking!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the change was effected; and the women now stood erect and
      face to face. The commoner and more outcast creature seemed utterly
      stupefied by what had taken place. Suddenly the other seized both her
      hands, and said quickly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The river&mdash;is it there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light seemed suddenly to flash in upon the outcast&rsquo;s bewildered brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a-going to drown yourself? No!&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This with a peculiar smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use; there&rsquo;s too many eyes a-watching. I tried it myself once,
      slap off the Embankment, but I was fished out like a wet rag. Don&rsquo;t you be
      such a fool! You&rsquo;re a lady, and you had best go home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, the lady began to move rapidly away. Seized by a
      peculiar impulse, the outcast cried after her&mdash;&lsquo;Come back&mdash;take
      your things&mdash;it&rsquo;s a shame for me to have them. Take them back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; keep them. Good-bye. May I kiss you?&rsquo; &lsquo;If you like,&rsquo; was the
      stupefied reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lips of the two women met, their breaths mingled for a moment. Then,
      while the one stood petrified, staring in utter astonishment, the other
      flitted rapidly and silently away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;A DANCING LESSON UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>welve years before
      the occurrence of the incident described in my prologue, a curious group
      was assembled in a quiet corner of Grayfleet Churchyard. Gray fleet is a
      damp, aguish, lonely, desolate village, on the verge of the great Essex
      marshes; and its old church, like a skull with two empty, lifeless eyes,
      gazes with two dreary windows right down on the marshes, towards that
      low-lying mist where they mingle with the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group of which I have spoken consisted of some six girls and one
      little boy. The girls were of divers ages, from six to sixteen, and all
      were more or less smartly dressed in holiday clothes, for it was a Good
      Friday. They stood in a ring round a flat tombstone, grey with age, and
      green with slime of moss. On this tombstone a fair little girl of eight,
      with dishevelled hair and flushed cheeks, was practising the first steps
      of a dance. Her instructress was the eldest of the party, a pale,
      red-haired wench of sixteen, who watched her with keenly critical eyes,
      and at times stepped forward, took her place on the tombstone, and showed
      her how to use her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      First position&mdash;heel and toe&mdash;cut and shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lookee here, Mawther!&rsquo; cried one of the girls to a passer by. &lsquo;Come and
      see Polly Lowther teaching Mark Peartree&rsquo;s girl to dance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another girl came running into the churchyard, and joined the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the style!&rsquo; exclaimed Polly Lowther, as the red-haired girl was
      called. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll soon learn, if you only try. Look at me, Madlin. Watch my
      feet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      First position&mdash;heel and toe&mdash;cut and shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls clapped their hands enthusiastically, and the little boy, who
      was sitting astride on a green grave, grinned approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fired by the applause bestowed on her teacher, the little fair girl&mdash;&lsquo;Madlin,&rsquo;
      as the others called her&mdash;began wildly practising the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      First position&mdash;heel and toe&mdash;cut and shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a rush, a cry. The troop of girls scattered on every
      side and disappeared: the little boy cried and ran. Only &lsquo;Madlin&rsquo;
      remained, so absorbed for the time being in her dancing that for a moment
      she did not notice that she was left alone, and that a tall figure in
      black, with white neckcloth, stood frowning at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she was conscious of her predicament. Flushed and panting,
      she stood and gazed, and recognised to her horror the Rector of the
      parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave one glance around, to see if she was quite abandoned, and then,
      seeing no trace of her companions, she curtsied timidly, and stood her
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little girl,&rsquo; said the Rector, in a terrible voice, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know you&mdash;what
      is your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head awkwardly, and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear me? What is your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl raised her head, looked straight at the Rector, and
      answered in a clear voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, sir, I&rsquo;m Madlin&mdash;Mark Peartree&rsquo;s girl.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rector&rsquo;s brows came down still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark Peartree; I think I know the man&mdash;he lives down at the ferry,
      and sails in a barge. Is he your father?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who had a common straw hat swinging by the ribbon in her mouth,
      gnawed the ribbon, and replied shortly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is he, then?&rsquo; asked the Rector. &lsquo;Some relation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the immediate reply. &lsquo;I call him uncle, but he isn&rsquo;t a <i>real</i>
      uncle, nor Uncle Luke neither. I&rsquo;m a foundling&mdash;Aunt Jane found me,
      out <i>there!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a back sweep of her hand, the little girl indicated the great
      marshes, steaming and reddening in the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whoever you are, are you not aware,&rsquo; said the Rector, improving the
      occasion, &lsquo;that you are a very wicked little girl? Upon this holy day of
      all days in the year I find you practising a vicious pastime here, in
      God&rsquo;s own acre! On a tombstone! Little girl, do you know that there is a
      dead fellow-creature lying under you, and that you are profaning his place
      of rest?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave a start and a scared look downward, as if half expecting the
      dead man to arise and confront her; then half unconsciously she edged off
      the tombstone and stood ankle deep in the long churchyard grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said the Rector, shaking his forefinger at her. &lsquo;I am
      really very much afraid that you have been very badly brought up. Tell me,
      have you ever heard the word of God? Do you ever go to church?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was at any rate prompt and explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;never.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I thought so. A sad case. And your father&mdash;I mean your adopted
      father&mdash;is he not ashamed of himself to bring you up in ignorance and
      sin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was touching rather a dangerous chord. The little girl flushed,
      panted, opened her large blue eyes full on the minister and exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Mark isn&rsquo;t ashamed of himself, no more is Uncle Luke! They go to
      their meeting, and I go too. They&rsquo;re United Brethren, and when I grow up,
      <i>I&rsquo;m</i> to be a Brethren too!9
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brethren!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in a tone which clearly implied that their cup of moral
      delinquency, in the Rector&rsquo;s eyes, was now full and overflowing. The good
      pastor could have endured a family which repudiated Christianity
      altogether, but any form of Dissent was worse even than the rankest
      blasphemy. It is doubtful what turn the interview would have taken, but
      just at this moment an unexpected diversion took place. A thin shrill
      voice, doubtless appertaining to one of the little girl&rsquo;s late companions,
      suddenly pealed out, from some mysterious corner where its owner lay
      hidden&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look out, Madlin! Here&rsquo;s your Uncle Luke a-comin&rsquo;!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked startled; then, strange to say, her face grew quite bright
      and eager. The Rector seemed perplexed, and uncertain what to say next.
      Just then the gate of the churchyard opened, and a little man, with very
      short legs and a very large head, looked in, and seeing Madeline, quietly
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle! Uncle Luke!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man nodded his head and smiled. Then, seeing the Rector, he
      took off his hat and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a peculiarity of the little man that he expressed all thoughts and
      moods by means of a rather mindless smile, sometimes broadening into a
      grin. For the rest, he had large watery eyes and a large mouth, and his
      general appearance was homely and awkward in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Madeline was at his side, holding his hand and looking up
      into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rector strode across the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have just been warning this child against dancing upon the tombstones.
      I have told her that she is a very wicked child, and she has informed me
      that her relations belong to some Methodist persuasion. Be that as it may,
      you will doubtless agree with me that her conduct to-day has been
      extremely sacrilegious.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man, still holding his hat in his hand, looked at the Rector,
      then looked at Madeline, then smiled imbecilely, then, feeling the smile
      out of place, tried to frown, but only succeeded in distorting his
      good-humoured countenance into a confirmed grin. Then suddenly darting his
      mouth down to the little girl&rsquo;s ear, he hoarsely whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Madlin? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Polly Lowther was teaching me to cut and shuffle,&rsquo; said the girl out
      loud, fixing her eyes in a fearless way on the Rector; &lsquo;and Parson came
      out and found us, and all the others ran away. I know dancing&rsquo;s wicked,
      because Uncle Mark says so, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, and Parson says Uncle
      Mark ought to be ashamed of himself, and I told Parson it isn&rsquo;t <i>true!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This explanation seemed to confuse the little man still more. He scratched
      his head and peeped at the Rector with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dancing&rsquo;s downright wicked,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;no doubt o&rsquo; that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no laughing matter,&rsquo; cried the Rector, indignantly, irritated at
      the unaccountable expression on the little man&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Be good enough to
      leave the precincts of the church. The child is a bad child, and has been
      badly trained. There, there, hold your tongue&mdash;I desire no further
      explanations; only remember this, if that child desecrates the churchyard
      again, I shall resort to severer measures.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he waved the pair from the churchyard, shut the gate sharply
      upon them, and stalked away to the Rectory, with a bosom full of holy
      emotion and Christian wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man stood for some minutes in the open road, dazed, gaping, and
      looking at the tall retreating figure. Then he quietly put on his hat,
      and, conscious of the little hand within his own, looked down at his
      companion, at a loss what to say or do. At last he cut the Gordian knot of
      his perplexity by grinning from ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Parson be in a powerful rage,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but dancing be downright wicked,
      that&rsquo;s a fact;&rsquo; and he added, with a perplexed look, as if communing with
      his own thoughts, &lsquo;What shall I say to your Uncle Mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline seemed to muse for some moments, then, as if struck by a sudden
      inspiration, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along, Uncle Luke&mdash;let&rsquo;s go home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man laughed contentedly, as if finding in the proposition a
      solution of all his difficulty; and the little legs began to move. Hand in
      hand, the two hurried down the descent leading from the church to the
      outskirts of the village. As they went along, Madeline peeped up quietly
      from time to time at her companion, as if trying to read his thoughts;
      then, squeezing his hand tight, she said in a coaxing voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Luke!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Madlin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t tell Uncle Mark about my dancing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;dancing be downright wicked.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Polly Lowther offered to teach me, and all the other
      girls can dance a bit. And if you won&rsquo;t say a word to Uncle Mark, I&rsquo;ll let
      you cut up my new money-box that Uncle Mark gave me, and find out what&rsquo;s
      inside.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unaccountable as it may seem, this extraordinary proposition seemed to
      find peculiar favour in Uncle Luke&rsquo;s eyes. His large eyes twinkled, and
      his mouth broadened from ear to ear, but he pretended to shake his head
      from side to side in solemn deprecation of the bribe. Madeline watched him
      keenly, and just as he seemed wavering, she lifted his great brown hand to
      her mouth, and gave it a passionate kiss. This seemed to unsettle Uncle
      Luke altogether, and he murmured eagerly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Madlin, <i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t tell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Madeline knew well that a promise of this sort from Uncle Luke was as
      good as an oath from any other man. They quickened their pace, but she
      continued to play with and fondle his hand, and now and then to hold it to
      her lips. Confidence of this sort was what the little man loved best of
      all things in the world, and the smile upon his face grew broad and bright
      with intelligent content.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;&lsquo;UNCLE&rsquo; LUKE AND &lsquo;UNCLE&rsquo; MARK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the setting
      sun gleamed on Grayfleet, its grim church, and its cluster of red-tiled
      dwellings, Uncle Luke took a footpath leading across the marshes. All
      around them the landscape was flat and level, with little or no
      vegetation; for over the dark low levels the sea had crawled, and would
      crawl again. Here and there hovered a seagull, tempted in from the distant
      salt water, and searching the marsh for plunder; and once, as they passed
      a shallow pool, blood-red in the light, a heron rose with a harsh cry and
      flapped slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A walk of half a mile across the marsh brought them to the river side, and
      within view of a sort of pendant to the upper village, in the shape of a
      row of tiny red-tiled cottages on the very bank. Here there was a
      ferry-house, with a licence &lsquo;to sell ale and tobacco.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned into the river path, the ferry-boat was crossing leisurely,
      with a freight of country girls on their way home from Grayfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke trotted cheerfully along, still holding Madeline by the hand.
      Her eyes were now on the shining river and the drifting ferry-boat, and
      she had almost forgotten her scene with the Rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a curious pair. The girl was a slender slight thing, wild as
      some wayside weed. Her form was curiously light and graceful; her face,
      with its large passionate eyes, very wistful and sad. The common cotton
      frock and coarse country shoes and stockings became her well, though her
      limbs were somewhat long and shapeless as yet. And if the girl was not a
      little fairylike, Uncle Luke would certainly have passed well for a Gnome,
      or say rather, one of those quaint Trolls whose task it was, according to
      Scandinavian legend, to work busily in the bowels of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the week long Uncle Luke <i>did</i> work, on the black river barge of
      which he was mate and his brother captain. From Monday to Saturday his
      figure was clad in blue jersey, red cap, and rough tarpaulin trousers, and
      he helped to work the barge on its short journeys up and down the crowded
      river. But on the present occasion, it being a holiday, his attire was
      radiant&mdash;a high chimney-pot hat, very broad at the brim, and large
      enough to descend to his ears, a blue pilot coat, a white waistcoat, and a
      coloured cotton shirt, blue navy trousers, and lace-up boots. For Uncle
      Luke loved splendour, and nothing suited him better than to shine glorious
      in the eyes of his neighbours; though Uncle Mark, who was his elder
      brother, and strictly pious, disapproved of all these vanities of apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be admitted, without further preamble, that Uncle Luke, though
      able-bodied, was mentally deficient; indeed, in the estimation of many
      sober and wiser people, a simple fool, or, in the local parlance, little
      better than a natural. Yet his shortcomings were by no means upon the
      surface, and it would have taken a very wise man to understand them at a
      glance. He was harmless, industrious, and in some respects particularly
      shrewd. He knew how many pence make a shilling, and how many shillings a
      pound, as well as most men, and he had a sharp intuitive perception of
      human character. With all this he was simple beyond measure, and his
      reasoning faculties were absolutely infinitesimal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great as was his good nature, he strongly resented any imputation on his
      sagacity. His brother Mark had secured him work at a very low wage, on the
      understanding that he was weak and easily tired; and there on the barge,
      under his brother&rsquo;s eye, he laboured cheerfully, save when some one was
      cruel enough to take advantage of his weakness or to deride his infirmity.
      At such times, he was subject to wild fits of passion. When these were
      over, he would creep into the cabin, cry like a child, and perhaps take to
      his hammock for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-day he looked happy enough, partly on account of his lucky escape
      from the Rector, and partly because Madeline had promised him the
      unparalleled treat of cutting open her bright new money-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a kind of temptation he never could resist. Had he possessed a
      watch, he would have taken it to pieces to examine the works; and he had
      been languishing with curiosity for days, puzzling his head, as many a
      child has done, to know what was inside the money-box labelled &lsquo;Savings&rsquo;
      Bank,&rsquo; with its front pointed like a town hall, and a slit in its top for
      the reception of vagrant pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having come in sight of the ferry, the two walked on quickly. The sun
      blazed down on them with golden splendour, and from beneath their feet the
      dust arose in a cloud. Neither spoke; Madeline continued to impress an
      occasional kiss on the hand which she still held fondly in hers&mdash;and
      to each of these exhibitions of feeling her companion replied by a broad
      grin. Suddenly, however, he gave a start and, looking down at his flushed
      and dusty companion, said quickly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Madlin, you&rsquo;d best put on your Sunday hat. There be Uncle Mark at
      the garden gate!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, Madeline obeyed. She took the hat, which for coolness and
      comfort she had swung on her arm, and tied it carefully on her head. Then
      regaining possession of her uncle&rsquo;s hand, she walked decorously up to one
      of the little green cottage gates, on the other side of which stood,
      indeed, her Uncle Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Luke and Mark were brothers, they were as unlike one another as two
      men could possibly be. Mark Peartree stood six feet in his shoes; he was
      very thin, and he stooped slightly at the shoulders. His hair was grey,
      his face red as a Ripston pippin, but his cheeks were sunken, perhaps from
      the loss of many teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage was one of a row of red brick, with creepers crawling over the
      front, a small plot of garden facing the river, enclosed by green wooden
      railings and a green wooden gate. Upon one of the gates now leaned Uncle
      Mark, clad, too, in his Sunday best, but much less gaudily than Luke, and
      looking down the road with impatience marked on every lineament of his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you be at last,&rsquo; he said, when the vagrant pair came up. &lsquo;Why, mate
      alive, can&rsquo;t you be home at meal times? Mother&rsquo;s in a powerful rage.
      Brother Brown be coming this afternoon, and he&rsquo;ll be here afore we can get
      our wittles done!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this speech the smile faded from Luke&rsquo;s face; but, before he could
      utter a word in reply, another voice, evidently that of a female, chimed
      in from the cottage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure, father, it be like you to be asking Brother Brown and the
      Brethren here of a Good Friday, as if we didn&rsquo;t get enough of them every
      day i&rsquo; the year. However, coming they be, but we shan&rsquo;t get the dinner
      over any the quicker with you standing racketing there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker stood in the doorway, the red brick and the green creepers
      framing her as she stood. A comfortable looking woman, dressed in a clean
      cotton gown, with a coarse white apron tied round her waist. She was short
      and stout, with a brown good-humoured face and glossy black hair. She wore
      a cap the long ends of which were thrown over her shoulders and pinned
      behind, as if for freedom; her sleeves were rolled up nearly to the elbow,
      and her hands and arms were mottled brown and red with constant work in
      soap and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of this figure, no other indeed than Mrs. Mark Peartree, or, as
      Madeline called her, &lsquo;Aunt Jane,&rsquo; the good-humoured grin again took
      possession of Uncle Luke&rsquo;s face. Passing through the little gate he made
      for the door and at once entered the house, while Madeline transferred her
      attentions to Uncle Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any fault o&rsquo; Uncle Luke&rsquo;s,&rsquo; she said, looking up into the
      weather-beaten face, &lsquo;indeed, Uncle Mark, &rsquo;twas all on account o&rsquo;
      <i>me</i> that he was so long&mdash;I was up there with Polly Lowther,
      looking at the graves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In her eagerness to excuse her favourite, Madeline might have revealed the
      dreaded secret of the dance, but Uncle Mark, who had his own reasons for
      wishing to get the dinner quickly disposed of, patted her hand and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, Madlin, my lass;&rsquo; and, taking her small hot hand in his big
      horny first, led her into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very small house. A long narrow passage led from the front door
      to the back, and midway in the passage was a flight of narrow carpetless
      stairs. On the right opened out two rooms&mdash;a kitchen, and a parlour,
      as it was called. During the week, while the men were at work on the
      river, the parlour was carefully closed up. No fire was ever lit in it&mdash;it
      was dark, well polished, and genteel, with a bit of drugget for a carpet,
      a china shepherd and shepherdess, and several shells on the mantelpiece,
      and on the walls two highly illuminated pictures, one representing the
      Prodigal Son, the other Susannah and the Elders. But in the centre of the
      mantelpiece stood the crowning glory of the apartment&mdash;a small
      &lsquo;weather-cottage&rsquo; made of wood, formed in the shape of a roofed shed, and
      containing two figures, one of &lsquo;Darby&rsquo; and another of &lsquo;Joan,&rsquo; standing on
      either side of a piece of wood, suspended in the centre by a quicksilver
      pole. When the weather was fine, Joan swung out, with her basket on her
      arm, as if going to market, and left Darby under cover; when it was wet,
      Joan retreated, and Darby emerged to brave the elements like a man. This
      weather-cottage was a miracle of art in Madeline&rsquo;s eyes, and was regarded
      with no little reverence by all the members of the house. Indeed, the
      parlour altogether was a sanctuary, full of a pious clamminess and
      darkness, and even Mrs. Peartree never entered it without a certain awe,
      tempered with a sense of increased respectability. From week&rsquo;s end to
      week&rsquo;s end they remained in the red-tiled kitchen, while on Sunday
      evening, and indeed on every festive occasion like the present, the
      parlour was thrown open for the family use.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;EASTER SOLEMNITIES OF THE BRETHREN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was in the paven
      kitchen, however, that the party now assembled, and taking their seats
      round the square deal table, which was spread with a clean table-cloth,
      began at once upon the dinner&mdash;a boiled leg of pork and potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her little feet swinging to and fro, and her large blue wistful eyes
      roving wistfully about the room, Madeline sat and ate up her portion
      contentedly. The sun streaming through the back window caressed her bright
      cheek and dusty hair, and made her think of the glad light which had
      touched her only a short time ago, while she had been learning to dance
      upon the tombs. Suddenly a strange thought seemed to strike her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Mark,&rsquo; she said, while Uncle Luke dropped his knife and fork in
      wonder, &lsquo;can dead folk <i>feel?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my lass,&rsquo; returned Uncle Mark, with some little surprise in his mild
      blue eyes. &lsquo;Dead men is dead as nails is&mdash;they can&rsquo;t feel nothing.
      What put that into your head?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madeline did not answer; a sense of great satisfaction had stolen over
      her at this brief assurance, and, with a glance of meaning at Uncle Luke,
      she said to herself that, for once in his life, the parson had been wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner being over, there was a general movement, and a great awe came over
      the family as the door of communication between the kitchen and parlour
      was thrown open, and the latter was seen in all its sepulchral splendour.
      Uncles Mark and Luke passed reverently in, and closed the door; but soon
      Madeline was made straight and clean, and sent in after them, while Aunt
      Jane, who seemed seized with unaccountable irritability, remained to tidy
      up the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the parlour, Madeline crept up to the window, and gazed with
      wistful dreamy eyes across the little garden on the great still river,
      which crept past flashing and darkening in the sun. Uncle Mark, seated on
      a very shiny and sticky horsehair sofa, was deep in the pages of the
      family Bible, while Uncle Luke, with a face as grave as a judge, was
      repeating in an undertone the words of an Easter hymn. All was quiet and
      still in the sepulchral chamber; but through the closed door they could
      distinctly hear the rattling of dishes, the clangour of pots and pans,
      from the kitchen. Presently this rattling and clangour became positively
      furious, and simultaneously a loud rat-a-tat was heard at the front door.
      Finally, to the same noisy accompaniment, the room door was opened, and a
      number of visitors came in one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      They consisted of a tall thin man, dressed in glossy black, with a long
      thin face, broad protruding forehead, and a bald head; followed by several
      very rough-looking figures in high hats and rude Sunday suits. Each as he
      entered doffed his hat, with a nod of solemn greeting to Uncles Mark and
      Luke. The tall man paused in the centre of the room and breathed heavily,
      while Uncle Mark rose to receive him. He was evidently expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man in black, a retired tradesman, known in the neighbourhood as
      &lsquo;Brother Brown,&rsquo; was the leader of the sect known as the &lsquo;United
      Brethren,&rsquo; of which Uncles Mark and Luke were lowly members. He was a
      person of some importance and some property, but, having no wider field in
      which to practise his feats of piety, he was content every Sunday to visit
      the row of cottages, and, gathering his satellites together in one house
      or another, discourse to them on the lights and shadows of another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the keen glance into the room, Brother Brown gave his whole hand to
      Uncle Mark, and the tips of his fingers to Uncle Luke, nodded grimly to
      Madeline, and sinking on the sofa, covered his face with large red hands,
      and sank into deep silence. This manoeuvre was followed by all the others
      present except Madeline. Each covered his face with his hand, and took a
      gentle header, so to speak, into himself. If we may continue the metaphor,
      all remained under water for many minutes. The effect was awe-inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Brother Brown uncovered his face and came up refreshed; the other
      men emerged one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother Peartree,&rsquo; he said, addressing Uncle Mark, &lsquo;are we all here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; answered Uncle Mark, while his blue eyes wandered over the
      group. &lsquo;Here be Brother Strangeways, Brother Smith, Brother Hornblower,
      Brother Billy Horn-blower, Brother Luke Peartree, and myself. Not to speak
      of little Madlin&mdash;she axed to come in, and a child can&rsquo;t begin too
      early.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Brown coughed heavily and looked at the kitchen door, through
      which came at intervals a dull clangour as of pots and pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I suppose,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Sister Peartree is still obdurate. Will she
      not join our little gathering, and listen for once to the words of
      healing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Mark looked very red and uncomfortable, and jerked his thumb
      awkwardly towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind the missus to-day, Brother Brown&mdash;she&rsquo;s had a heap o&rsquo;
      worrit during the week, and the fact is, she ain&rsquo;t just tidy enough to
      come into the best parlour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Brown&rsquo;s heavy brow darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Six days shalt thou labour,&rdquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Well, brother, you are the head
      of your own house, and I leave our unregenerate sister to you. Let us
      pray.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon all, including Madeline, knelt down, while Brother Brown
      exercised his spirit in a long prayer, with variations and expressions of
      sympathy in the form of low groans and ejaculations from his companions&mdash;who
      had all again (to resume a former metaphor) retired under water. Emerging
      once more, and receiving a signal from Brother Brown, Brother Billy
      Hornblower, an overgrown young bargee of twenty, began a homely hymn, in
      which all the others gruffly joined.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the music grew louder, the clatter in the kitchen increased, to the
      obvious dissatisfaction of Brother Mark. The hymn ceased, and Brother
      Brown delivered a short sermon, founded on the text, &lsquo;Those that go down
      to the sea in ships,&rsquo; which was felt to be especially suitable to those
      who went down the river in barges.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Brother Mark rose, and in a few brief words, interspersed
      freely with Scriptural quotations, addressed the Brethren, taking for his
      theme the sacred character of the day, and greatly troubling the soul of
      little Madeline by gloomy references to dead sinners in their graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short address to the same effect from Brother Strangeways, a
      waterside worthy with a very weatherbeaten face and a very weather wise
      sort of oratory, and another hymn from Brother Billy Hornblower, the
      service was concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as a concluding solemnity, all shook hands, and the conversation
      suddenly grew secular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going down with the tide i&rsquo; the morning, mate?&rsquo; asked Brother
      Strangeways. &lsquo;It be high water at four, and we be loaded since day afore
      yesterday.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where for, mate?&rsquo; asked Uncle Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down right away Southam,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, mate, <i>I</i> be anchored at home with the old woman till Monday,
      and then I goes up with first flood to Crewsham Basin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lime?&rsquo; asked Brother Strangeways, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lime it is,&rsquo; answered Brother Mark, and forthwith the talk became
      professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Brother Brown had drawn from his pocket several loose
      leaves or tracts, a species of torpedo which he was in the habit of
      dropping surreptitiously wherever he went, for the confusion of
      recalcitrant and unrepentant sinners. Selecting three of these, each of
      which had special reference to the forlorn spiritual condition of a person
      of the other sex, he proceeded to pin them on the parlour walls&mdash;one
      over the Shepherdess on the mantelpiece, a second under the picture of the
      Prodigal Son, a third under that of Susannah and the Elders. When this was
      done he shook hands with Uncle Mark, nodded to Uncle Luke, and passed out
      of the house; the other men, each with a &lsquo;Good night, mate,&rsquo; for each of
      the two Pear-trees, immediately followed, solemnly, in single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the street door closed than Mrs. Pear-tree, with the sleeves
      of her gown tucked up to the elbow, entered the precincts of the chamber.
      Scorn was in every lineament of her countenance, but directly her eyes
      fell on the parlour walls, the scorn deepened to wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother Brown&rsquo;s been at them walls again,&rsquo; she cried. I wonder at <i>you</i>,
      Mark Peartree, to sit still and see him do it. Tracts agin your own wedded
      wife, stuck on the walls of her own best parlour&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;d &ldquo;tract&rdquo;
       him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she made a dash at each of the papers in succession, and
      tore them angrily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lass,&rsquo; said Uncle Mark, gruffly, &lsquo;read&rsquo;em&mdash;they&rsquo;re left for your
      convarsion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff and rubbish!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Salvation ain&rsquo;t rubbish, mother, and this here earth&rsquo;s a wale. A wale it
      is! And let me tell you, tho&rsquo; you are my missus, it don&rsquo;t become you to
      put Brother Brown so much about. Why, while we was a-singing, I heard you
      clattering the dishes like a barge a-heaving anchor, and I see Brother
      Brown looking at the door out of the corner of his eyes. No, my lass, it
      don&rsquo;t become you, and it ain&rsquo;t settin&rsquo; a good example to little Madlin,
      who may be a wessel herself by and by.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, if I can help it,&rsquo; answered the woman. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve wessels enough in <i>our</i>
      family, what with you and Uncle Luke. Look at the mark o&rsquo; the dirty muddy
      feet on the clean carpet. I wish you&rsquo;d meet outside, or in some other
      house but mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I wish <i>you&rsquo;d</i> join us&mdash;it&rsquo;d do you a power of good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree&rsquo;s only answer was to toss her head and walk back into the
      kitchen. Uncle Luke followed very crestfallen and pitiful at the domestic
      disagreement; while Uncle Mark remained in the parlour, and showed the
      pictures in Foxe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of Martyrs&rsquo;&mdash;a precious tome of tremendous
      antiquity&mdash;to Madeline. The child shuddered as she saw on every page
      flame consuming those who testified to the truth in evil times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Mark,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;do they ever burn people <i>now?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in this here world, my lass; only in t&rsquo;other. And even then only the
      wery bad ones&mdash;them as hates their neighbours, and can come to no
      manner o&rsquo; good <i>without</i> burning!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not answer, but she thought of Aunt Jane, who was the very
      essence of gentleness and good nature, but who was made utterly
      unregenerate by the intensity of her hate for Brother Brown.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Madeline
      slipped from her bed on the Tuesday after Easter Monday, drew aside the
      chintz curtains from her little window and looked forth, she was
      astonished to see that the sunshine of the preceding days had been
      followed by a drizzling rain. The river looked black and very solemn as it
      slipped between its sedgy banks; the marshes, turning a white face to the
      sullen sky, looked dreary enough as they drank in the falling rain, and
      the red tiles on the houses of Grayfleet were redder than ever with the
      ceaseless washing of the showers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had slept heavily, but had not yet wholly recovered from the
      depression caused by the preaching of the past few days, and of so many
      hours spent in the sanctuary of the best room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed hastily, ran down stairs, and peeped into the parlour at the
      &lsquo;weather cottage.&rsquo; Alas! Joan was under shelter, and Darby was outside. So
      it was to be a wet day indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was very quiet. The front door stood open and a clammy breeze
      swept into the passage and kissed her cheeks. The parlour had been cleared
      out an hour before by Aunt Jane&rsquo;s industrious hands, and was carefully
      prepared for next Sunday. But a clear fire burned in the kitchen, casting
      its light on the bright paven floor, and upon the buxom figure of Aunt
      Jane herself, who stood by the table preparing breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh, bless the child, how you did make me jump!&rsquo; she exclaimed, as
      Madeline put her* head in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, lass, and get your breakfast; &rsquo;tis near time you were
      starting for school.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After bestowing a hearty kiss on Mrs. Peartree&rsquo;s sunburnt cheek, Madeline
      took her seat at the table; then suddenly looking round she asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Aunt Jane, where be Uncle Luke?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone away two hours or more wi&rsquo; Uncle Mark; they sailed up wi&rsquo; the tide
      an hour afore thou was out o&rsquo; thy bed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone to London without <i>me!</i>&rsquo; cried Madeline, her large eyes filling
      with tears. &lsquo;Uncle Luke did promise to take me with him this time!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there, ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo; your crying, like a good lass!&rsquo; said Aunt
      Jane, soothingly. Your Uncle Luke he did want to take ye, but I would have
      none on&rsquo;t this woyage. A pretty like morning to take you from your bed!&mdash;why
      the rain was falling and the wind blowing enough to give you your death.
      But if you are a good lass and learn your lessons well you shall go next
      time. They&rsquo;ll bring down the barge to-morrow, and likely they&rsquo;ll be for
      taking her back o&rsquo; Thursday. Then you shall go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this assurance Madeline was fain to content herself. She had been on
      the barge once or twice when it had lain in Gray fleet basin, opposite the
      ferry; she had seen it spread out its great red wings and glide along the
      track of the river&mdash;until it looked like a great black swan&mdash;passing
      silently between the marshes, and fading behind the grey mist which for
      ever hung about them like a cloud; and her childish imaginations had often
      conjured up pictures of the strange scenes towards which the great black
      swan was drifting. London was to her the great world, the mysterious city,
      so different to the dark slimy river and low-lying marshes of Grayfleet.
      Ever since she could remember, this magic word &lsquo;London&rsquo; had been the one
      which had ever urged her on to good deeds, the final goal to which all her
      virtuous deeds were to lead. Whenever she was bad, Aunt Jane never forgot
      to repeat the awful words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Madlin, if you can&rsquo;t be a better lass, you shall never go to
      London with me and Uncle Mark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she had been unusually good she never failed to hear the timeworn
      promise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been downright good! You shall go to London with me, and see the
      great waxwork wi&rsquo; the kings and queens, and the Sleepin&rsquo; Beauty as large
      as life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When this magical visit was to be paid seemed somewhat indefinite. That
      Aunt Jane was strongly opposed to what she called &lsquo;gadding about,&rsquo; may be
      gathered from the fact that during the six-and-twenty years of her married
      life she had spent only two days out of her own home. But Madeline had
      been content to hope and wait on&mdash;and dream over the many things she
      would do when at length the happy day did come. Just before Easter,
      however, she went half wild with ecstasy&mdash;for Uncle Luke in the
      exuberance of his gratitude to her for not laughing at him when his
      curiosity induced him to cut open a cheap concertina, &lsquo;to see where the
      music came from,&rsquo; promised to take her immediately on to the barge and
      show her himself the wonderful sights of the great City.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great blow to Madeline to learn that her uncles had departed to
      the magical place without her, but by the time she had finished her
      breakfast the sadness caused by the disappointment had worn away. She
      bestowed another impulsive kiss on Aunt Jane&rsquo;s brown cheek, and taking her
      books under her arm, trotted off gleefully through the rain towards the
      great red-brick public school where most of her days were spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wonderfully light-hearted all day, and when evening came she
      firmly refused Polly Lowther&rsquo;s invitation to take another dancing lesson,
      and trotted home to keep Aunt Jane company. She found the kitchen neat and
      clean as usual, with plates sparkling on the dresser, dishes smiling from
      the walls, and Mrs. Peartree sitting in their midst with a skein of
      worsted round her neck, and her busy fingers darning Uncle Mark&rsquo;s
      guernsey. When Madeline came she laid her work aside and got the tea. The
      two sat down together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madlin, what in the world be you a-laughing at?&rsquo; asked Aunt Jane
      presently, astonished at the continual outbursts and half-smothered
      laughter of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the life of her Madeline would not tell&mdash;she only knew that
      she felt within her a strange hysterical sort of joy which would not be
      suppressed. Everything made her laugh; the gleaming dishes, the glancing
      firelight, the cat purring on the hearth, Aunt Jane&rsquo;s sunburnt face, and
      even her looks of astonishment and frowns of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree looked distressed; for she was superstitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As sure as you&rsquo;re alive, Madlin,&rsquo; she cried reprovingly, &lsquo;that laugh o&rsquo;
      yourn means no good. I mind the day my poor brother Jim were drowned dead&mdash;I
      was laughing like a mad thing afore I got the news. Them as laughs i&rsquo; the
      morning will cry before night, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this solemn warning Madeline&rsquo;s hilarity received a sudden check, only
      to burst out again with renewed vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not on account of bad news, Aunt Jane!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis
      because I&rsquo;m soon going with Uncle Mark to London!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Jane was not to be convinced. She gravely shook her head, and a
      few hours later when she put the child to bed she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Madlin, try to go to sleep, do, and give o&rsquo;er that giggling&mdash;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      nature for a child to laugh so&mdash;and &lsquo;twill take all the sleep from my
      eyes wi&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; my poor dear brother that&rsquo;s gone to heaven.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline promised implicit obedience, and nestled her dark little head
      into the snowy pillow. When she found herself alone, she slipped from her
      bed, drew aside the window curtain and looked out, half expecting to see
      the great black barge sail, like a spectre, through the hazy mist of rain.
      But no such vision appeared&mdash;the faint ray of the young moon showed
      her the silently sleeping river, through the silvery threads of rain which
      still fell from the ever-darkening sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Mark, Uncle Luke!&rsquo; exclaimed Madeline, clapping her hands, &lsquo;make
      haste and come home, and I&rsquo;ll try not to laugh any more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the barge, with Uncles Mark and Luke on board, was gliding
      slowly up the river, ten miles away. The wind had been fair all day and
      the barge had made good speed, but as night came on and the rain fell
      faster, the breeze completely died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barge lay heavily on the shining river, with the great red sail
      flapping listlessly above and black shadows all around. They had hoisted
      the side-lights, and now and then through the impenetrable blackness a
      faint light answered them&mdash;this was the only indication of human life
      which came to them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke was at the helm, peering with his small keen grey eyes into the
      blackness; and Uncle Mark was below, eating his supper. Presently the
      latter passed his red night-capped head out of the hatchway, and gave 8
      sharp glance around him; then his whole long body emerged, and he strolled
      to Luke&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, mate,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there don&rsquo;t seem much wind, and I&rsquo;m a-feared there
      ain&rsquo;t much a-coming; suppose you go and turn in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Uncle Luke shook his head decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Mark!&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;reckon <i>you&rsquo;re</i> more knocked up nor
      what I be. Just you turn in for a bit while &rsquo;tis calm&mdash;and
      when the wind comes I&rsquo;ll sing out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little more discussion as to which should get the first spell of
      sleep, Uncle Mark descended to the cabin and Luke was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very dreary above, very dark and wet; but Uncle Luke, who was
      generally in a happy state of mind, seemed quite contented. He grasped the
      tiller firmly in his hard, horny hand, and fixed his eyes with wonderful
      keenness upon the moving lights around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely any wind at all now, and the barge lay like a log; but
      ever and anon she was lifted up as on a bosom in gentle breathing, while
      the great sail flapped listlessly above, and the side-lights shone out
      like glimmering stars in the darkness, and flashed their brightness at the
      sky which loomed so darkly overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so passed thus, and then the rain gradually ceased to fall, the
      black in the sky began to float gently on before a cold, light wind, which
      bellied out the sail, swung the heavy boom over the side, and made the
      barge glide softly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke, holding the tiller more firmly, rapped sharply on the deck
      with his hob-nailed shoes, and in a very short space of time Uncle Mark
      emerged, fresh and active, from the cabin hatchway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, we shall get a goodish bit o&rsquo; wind before morning, mate,&rsquo; he said as
      he took possession of the tiller; &lsquo;get the sheets clear, Luke, we mustn&rsquo;t
      lose much time i&rsquo; working round;&mdash;remember the old barge ain&rsquo;t been
      over spry sin&rsquo; she got water-logged, and there be goodish bit o&rsquo; traffic
      here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke trotted aft obediently, and now that Mark had relieved him of
      all responsibility, he turned his mind again to solve the great problem
      which had been worrying him ever since he left home&mdash;whether he
      should take Madeline a present from the great City, or allow her to buy it
      for herself when she got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was speculating thus, his eyes were dreamily surveying the scene
      around him, and his hands were busy hauling in the sheets, for the breeze
      was coming more and more ahead, and less upon the quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the night passed off and day began to dawn, the breeze grew fresher and
      fresher, until it spread quite fiercely over the surface of the water,
      driving it up into little crisp wavelets fringed with foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick black clouds had drifted westwards, and left the east a mass of
      scarlet and grey. The landscape was still dim, as with distance, and the
      light was of that palpitating silvern kind which is neither daylight nor
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had left the low-lying marshes of Essex far behind them, and already
      they could see dimly in the distance, like a cloud brooding over a
      mountain peak, the smoke which for ever rises above the great City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river now seemed alive with traffic, barges beating onwards, laden
      almost to the water&rsquo;s edge&mdash;others running down&mdash;steam tugs and
      ocean steamers, blackening the air with smoke&mdash;all twining in and
      out, passing and repassing, in a bewildering maze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Mark still grasped the tiller, and though he performed his task with
      skill, it was a difficult job. The bends of the river were innumerable;
      often the wind came dead ahead; the barge was an unwieldy sailer at all
      times, and now she was overloaded into the bargain. Once or twice Uncle
      Mark, miscalculating her power of &lsquo;coming about,&rsquo; had brought her into
      danger, and had a narrow escape from collision. Then the river grew
      clearer and the wind came straight on the quarter. She scudded onward
      merrily, and the water all round her was white with foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look out, Mark, look out!&rsquo; cried Uncle Luke presently, and Uncle Mark,
      stooping to look under the red mainsail, saw that a steam-tug was swiftly
      steaming down on their course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s straight ahead. Ain&rsquo;t ye goin&rsquo; to keep away?&rsquo; screamed Uncle Luke,
      for the whistling of the wind was deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark noted the speed of the barge, then measured the distance between the
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, mate,&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll clear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barge sped on, the tug advanced quickly, Uncle Mark watched,
      carelessly at first, then anxiously. The tug was woefully near; by
      swerving slightly from her course she could have passed by the barge&rsquo;s
      stern&mdash;by keeping steadily on she seemed likely to cut it through the
      middle. Uncle Mark concluded that the tug would clear him; the tug
      calculated that the barge must &lsquo;keep away;&rsquo; and she came straight on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A collision seemed unavoidable, when Uncle Mark screamed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haul in the main sheet!&rsquo; and, with a cry, he put down the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had jibbed her as the only chance of escape. The barge swept round
      before the shrieking wind with her bowsprit within a few inches of the
      tug&rsquo;s side, quivering through and through as she heeled over, with a
      thunder crash, almost wrenching out the mast. Then there was a crash, like
      the bursting of a cannon, a great splash in the water&mdash;a shout from
      the tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke, who had been thrown flat on his face, scrambled to his feet to
      find the tiller abandoned, the great boom in two, the mast bending like a
      reed, and Uncle Mark&mdash;gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoned by the helmsman, the barge swept round into the wind, with her
      great sails flapping uselessly, and her whole fabric like a drifting
      wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused by the accident and the thunderous sound of shrouds and sails,
      Uncle Luke, who could not at any time get his ideas to work quickly, gazed
      about him for a few moments in horrified despair&mdash;then he saw that
      the tug, having reversed her engines, was close upon the barge, and that a
      boat which she had put out was rowing swiftly towards a figure which was
      floating, apparently lifeless, on the waves&mdash;the figure of Uncle
      Mark. Dead? It seemed so&mdash;the body was moveless, the face livid, and
      it floated without a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Uncle Luke became aware that the deck of the barge was
      withdrawing itself from his feet. The shaking of the mast had wrenched
      open the timbers&mdash;the water was pouring in like a torrent, the barge
      was rapidly sinking. He leapt into the punt which floated behind, cut the
      painter with his knife, and, utterly unmindful of the barge, pulled
      rapidly to the spot where they were rescuing Uncle Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had got him into the boat by this time, and he lay in the stern
      motionless, his cheeks ashen grey, his lips bloody, his eyes half closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wild cry like that of a child, Luke leapt into the boat, abandoning
      his own, seized the cold wet hand, smoothed back the dripping hair, and
      began to cry and moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark, mate, open your eyes,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;What ails you?&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
      know Luke&mdash;your brother Luke?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mark answered neither by sign nor word&mdash;a splinter of the boom
      had struck him senseless, and almost killed him at a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;d best take him aboard,&rsquo; said one of the men; &lsquo;see, the barge is
      sinking fast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the barge settled down and disappeared, leaving only the point
      of her topmast visible above the waves. But poor Luke thought nothing of
      the vessel; his thoughts were full of the injured man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do ye live, mate?&rsquo; asked one of the sailors from the tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Grayfleet, master,&rsquo; answered Luke, sobbing, and still chafing the cold
      limp hand. &lsquo;And oh, mates, do take him aboard, and get him home quick, and
      then mayhap he won&rsquo;t die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The men agreed to take the two men on board, especially as their course
      lay past Grayfleet. Nevertheless, as they looked on the face of Uncle
      Mark, they firmly believed it to be the face of a corpse. But after they
      had got him aboard the tug, stripped him of his wet clothes, and
      administered some restoratives, he heaved a little sigh, and opened his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Luke, mate,&rsquo; he said, recognising his brother, &lsquo;try and say a prayer for
      me. I doubt I&rsquo;m a dead man!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;UNCLE MARK SAILS UP THE SHINING RIVER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ll that night
      Madeline, sleeping peacefully, had been dreaming happy dreams. Her little
      feet had been pattering through the busy streets of the Golden City; her
      wondering eyes had been feasted with all the gay sights, her ears with all
      the gay sounds, which the wondrous ways afford. When she awoke in the
      morning, she was a little disappointed, and a good deal astonished, to
      find herself in her little room at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was broad daylight, and Madeline thought it must be late; Mrs. Peartree
      stood at the window, gazing dreamily forth. Madeline lay for a time and
      watched her; then she said suddenly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you looking at, Aunt Jane?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the voice the woman turned, and bent to impress her usual
      kiss on the flushed little cheek on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up, Madlin,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis close on eight o&rsquo;clock, and
      you&rsquo;ll be late for school again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were you looking at?&rsquo; reiterated Madeline, after returning the
      caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nought, lass, nought&mdash;&rsquo;twas only one of them little steam
      tugs that stopped off the ferry and sent a boat ashore&mdash;but now the
      boat has gone back again, and the tug has steamed away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did it stop for?&rsquo; asked Madeline, rising on her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless the lass, how can I tell? for nought that consarns <i>us</i>, be
      sure. There, get up quick, and I&rsquo;ll cut the bread and butter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she departed, and Madeline, slipping from the bed, began to
      dress herself. She had pretty nearly completed her task, and had her arms
      raised, and her frock suspended above her head, when the sound of voices
      reached her from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened, and recognised the tones of Uncle Luke. Her heart bounded,
      her cheek flushed, a minute afterwards she flew down the stairs, thrusting
      her arms into the wrong sleeves, and alighted, radiant, panting, and
      half-dressed, on the kitchen floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Uncle Luke sure enough, but how strange he looked! His
      weather-beaten cheeks were ghastly&mdash;his nervous fingers worked at a
      big hole in his guernsey, he stared about him in perplexed silence, but
      when Madeline entered he quietly sat down and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It warn&rsquo;t no fault o&rsquo; mine, mother,&rsquo; he sobbed; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t think it! He went
      on hisself, he jibbed the old barge hisself, and that&rsquo;s how it all came
      about.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree looked aghast, and her cheeks gradually grew pale too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy onus, Luke, can you not speak?&rsquo; said she, irritably. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
      happened to Mark? Is he hurted?&mdash;is he&mdash;killed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she grew sick at heart with apprehension, and turning at a
      heavy sound of footsteps came face to face with her husband. He lay upon a
      stretcher covered with rugs and blankets, and carried by one or two of the
      Brethren who used to meet in the parlour on Good Friday. His face was
      deathly pale, but his eyes wandered restlessly about, and when they
      lighted on his wife&rsquo;s face they gleamed with recognition. He smiled
      faintly, and stretched towards her a trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee cry, mother,&rsquo; he said, seeing that her lips trembled and
      her eyes grew dim; then, seeing Madeline in the background ready to spring
      upon him, he added feebly, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come a-nigh me, little Madlin&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      a&rsquo;most worn out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree was a woman of strong emotions, but she had a wonderful
      power of self-control. She resolutely choked back the rising desire to
      scream and fall into hysterics&mdash;and laying her brown hand on her
      husband&rsquo;s cold wet brow, said quietly but firmly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mark, Mark&mdash;what&rsquo;s to do? I never thought to see my man brought
      back to me like this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then motioning Madeline to keep back, she had Uncle Mark carried into the
      bright warm kitchen, where the breakfast was set, and, bringing in the
      horsehair sofa from the parlour, drew it up beside the fire, and had him
      placed thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had need of her resolution, for all poor Uncle Luke could do in this
      time of trouble was to sit in a corner and cry like a child, asserting,
      with strange vehemence, that he had no hand in the disaster, while
      Madeline, as if for sympathy, sat by his side and cried too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement and excitement seemed to have completely overpowered Uncle
      Mark; no sooner did he get upon the couch than he sank back with his eyes
      closed, and seemed to breathe his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime one of the Brethren had run off for the doctor, while another
      held a glass containing a little whisky, and Mrs. Peartree, taking the
      drooping head under her arm, poured between the livid lips a few drops of
      the spirit. At this he seemed to revive a little&mdash;he opened his eyes,
      again recognised his wife, and fixed his gaze on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the messenger returned, flushed and panting from his run.
      The doctor wasn&rsquo;t at home, he said; he had gone to visit a patient several
      miles away; when he returned they would send him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Mark listened, smiling faintly, then he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t want ne&rsquo;er a doctor, mate. I&rsquo;ve got my physic at last, Lord
      knows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark, Mark, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee talk so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Peartree, almost breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Uncle Mark smiled faintly again, and reached forth his trembling hand
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use denying of it, I&rsquo;m agoing away.
      That there spar did the job for me&mdash;but nobody&rsquo;s to blame for it,
      only me;&rsquo; then, as his wandering gaze fell upon his brother, who sat
      sobbing in a corner, he asked suddenly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Luke, mate, what&rsquo;s come o&rsquo; th&rsquo; old barge?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She be clean sunk, mate,&rsquo; returned Luke, dashing away the tears with the
      back of his rough, weatherbeaten hand. &lsquo;She be sunk out there in the
      river, up to Southam Beacon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was a good wessel,&rsquo; said Mark, faintly; &lsquo;many&rsquo;s the year we sailed
      her, you and me. And she be sunk at last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, mate,&rsquo; cried Uncle Luke, piteously, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t take on about that. We&rsquo;ll
      get her up again, but if you go and die we shall all be adrift together&mdash;little
      Madlin, and mother, and me, and all our hearts&rsquo;ll be broke.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Mark did not reply; he lay back with closed eyes, his breathing was
      laboured, and the hand which lay in his wife&rsquo;s turned cold as stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mrs. Peartree&rsquo;s heart sank in dread, for she thought that he
      was dying, but she neither spoke nor moved; she only clasped the hand a
      little tighter in her own, and let the scalding tears run down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sorrowful group, and the warmth and comfort of the surroundings
      seemed to make the sorrow of parting more keen. There was a death-like
      silence in the room, the ticking of the old Dutch clock in the corner rang
      out bell-like and clear, and between the ticks came the stifled sobs of
      Madeline and Uncle Luke. The kettle was singing on the hob, the cat
      purring on the hearth, and the sun-rays creeping in through the window
      touched the bowed heads of those about the sofa, and laid a soft caressing
      hand on the child&rsquo;s trembling form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Uncle Mark opened his eyes, and rousing himself suddenly, gazed
      wildly about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Luke, mate,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that warn&rsquo;t right about the old barge. No, no, she
      bean&rsquo;t sunk. Why look, there she be a-sailing up to the bridge&mdash;only
      her sails be white&mdash;so white&mdash;and there be a chap in white at
      the helm. What&rsquo;s that noise? It be like a steamboat&rsquo;s whistle i&rsquo; the fog.
      Oh, if my head warn&rsquo;t so dazed-like I could hear it&mdash;but I be kind o&rsquo;
      stupid to-night. Give me a light; it&rsquo;s black dark.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Mark, it&rsquo;s morning,&rsquo; said Madeline, creeping to his side. &lsquo;Dear,
      dear Uncle Mark, can&rsquo;t you see the sun?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Uncle Mark did not seem to hear the child&rsquo;s voice. His eyes were fixed
      on vacancy, or, rather, on some vision unbeheld of eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look out there ahead,&rsquo; he said faintly. &lsquo;There be a white barge coming
      down with the wind on her quarter, and the waters all black beneath her.
      Look, there be folk in white standing on her deck and singing. Hark! that
      be Brother Billy Hornblower&rsquo;s voice, sure&mdash;ly?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Hornblower, who indeed stood near, turned pale at the mention of
      his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He think&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s me a-singing,&rsquo; he observed, brushing his sleeve across
      his eyes; and he added, bending gently over Uncle Mark, &lsquo;Will I sing a bit
      of a hymn, Brother Peartree?9
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; murmured Uncle Mark, closing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Brother Hornblower, clasping his hands before him and looking on
      vacancy, commenced to sing in his own peculiar style part of a hymn which
      was very popular with the Brethren of the river:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Up the shining river,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Sailing with the tide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Jesus is my pilot,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Jesus is my guide.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steer the wessel, Jesus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Steer it night and day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To the Golden City
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Far, far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      See how hard &rsquo;tis blowing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Th&rsquo;re&rsquo;ll be win; to-night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Tremble not, my brothers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      He will steer us right.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steer the wessel, Jesus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Steer it night and day.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To the Golden City
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Far, far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      While the hymn lasted, Uncle Mark remained lying in his wife&rsquo;s arms as if
      asleep&mdash;he remained so for some time after the hymn was done. The
      kettle went on singing, the cat went on purring, and the clock seemed to
      tick with more bell-like clearness than before. When he again opened his
      eyes the old wandering look had passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know me, Mark, dear?&rsquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, mother&mdash;I know ye all. There be Luke&mdash;there be little
      Madlin&mdash;and that be Brother Billy Hornblower&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
      a-dreaming that he was a-singing to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so I were, Brother Peartree,&rsquo; exclaimed the musician softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was ye now?9 said Uncle Mark, smiling gently. &lsquo;Well, mate, I take that as
      wery kind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes again. Brother Hornblower turned his simple face to
      Mrs. Peartree and whispered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There be another werse, Sister Peartree&mdash;shall I sing it? He seems
      to feel it kind o&rsquo; soothin&rsquo;, and,&rsquo; he added eagerly, &lsquo;them&rsquo;s blessed
      words.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree nodded; she could not speak, for her tears choked her; and
      the thin but musical voice piped again:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Who&rsquo;s afraid when Jesus
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Like an angel stands,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Holding sheet and tiller
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      In His holy hands?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steer the wessel, Jesus,
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Steer it night and day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To the Golden City
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Far, far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hymn ended this time, Uncle Mark opened his eyes, turned a
      radiant face to the singer&mdash;then he turned to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up the shininsr river,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Aye, there I be agoing straight away.
      Kiss me, mother, and let little Madlin kiss me too&mdash;I be goin&rsquo; to
      Jesus- -up the shining river to Jesus, mates. It be all for the best&mdash;if
      it weren&rsquo;t for you three I shouldn&rsquo;t mind goin&rsquo;.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Mark, Mark,&rsquo; sobbed his wife, now fairly breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee take on&mdash;there be one at the helm as&rsquo;ll
      look arter you, and Luke, and little Madlin too. He&rsquo;s taking me away, the
      old barge be sunk, and I be going up the river, mates&mdash;up the shining
      ri&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, and they thought he had passed away. Those were the last
      words which Uncle Mark spoke on earth, but he did not die at once. He lay
      on the sofa for several hours, breathing heavily, like one in a troubled
      sleep; the time dragged wearily on, the day brightened, then faded, and as
      the last rays of the setting sun fell across the floor, Uncle Mark heaved
      his last sigh. He passed away like one in sleep, lying in his wife&rsquo;s arms,
      and not for several minutes after his last breath was taken did they know
      that he was dead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;MADELINE IS ABOUT TO REALISE HER DREAM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or several days
      Uncle Mark lay solemnly silent in the front parlour. An inquest was held
      over him, and a careful inquiry made into the manner of his death, the
      jury bringing in a verdict to the effect that the people in the tug were
      in no respect to blame, and that the fatal result was entirely
      &lsquo;accidental.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, amid general grief, Uncle Mark was carried to his last home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brethren, with solemn faces, bore him to his grave; and when the
      simple service was over, one of them stood forward, and, with tears in his
      eyes, chanted forth the words of the simple hymn which he had sung to
      Brother Mark as he passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this Mrs. Peartree, who stood with the men at the grave, had borne
      her burthen well, but no sooner did she hear the hymn which had ceased, as
      it were, with her husband&rsquo;s dying breath, than she wailed and broke down.
      For a time all the bitterness of that sudden parting came back upon her;
      she clasped the hand of little Madeline, who stood by her, and burst into
      passionate tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not indulge her stormy grief for long; troubles and
      necessities clamoured like wolves around her, and turned her soul sick
      with a new fear. Now that her strong husband was gone, the whole weight of
      their little household was upon her; and no sooner was he in his grave
      than she had to speculate upon the future. The verdict of the jury
      destroyed all chance of receiving any compensation from the owners of the
      tug, and indeed Mrs. Peartree never dreamed of putting in any claim. Her
      husband&rsquo;s earnings had been small, but she had managed to save a little,
      enough to keep her for a week or so&mdash;&lsquo;to turn herself round,&rsquo; as she
      expressed it&mdash;while she decided what was best to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Luke Peartree was thrown upon her hands she knew from the moment of
      her husband&rsquo;s death. As we have said, he was generally regarded as a kind
      of natural; and everybody knew that had it not been for his brother he
      would never have got work at all. Mark Peartree had been a skilful
      bargeman, and in order to secure his services the barge-owners had been
      quite willing that he should sail with his brother as mate. Consequently,
      Mrs. Pear-tree knew that it was quite useless for him to seek for work
      alone. For a time she was at her wits&rsquo; end to know what to do with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she remembered that he had a cousin across the river in Kent who
      might be willing to give him work on a riverside farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote, and got for answer that Joss Peartree wanted an odd hand, and
      would be glad, for kinship&rsquo;s sake, to take on &lsquo;Cousin Luke.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Luke cried like a child when the news was told him, and Mrs. Peartree
      cried a bit too. It was like another death, this thought of parting with
      simple Luke, but what was she to do? She could not keep him; it was as
      much as she could do to keep herself&mdash;and the only prospect she saw
      of doing this was to go out as a monthly nurse, a post for which she was
      specially suited. Meantime her little store of money was rapidly
      diminishing, and each coin that was taken out warned her that her
      household must break up soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had cried silently for a time, she resolutely dried her eyes,
      and set about comforting Uncle Luke. She promised that if he would only
      try to be happy she would try to visit him once or twice a year&mdash;and
      after she had earned a little, she would try to rent a small room in
      Gray-fleet, and make it a home where Luke could come and stop again with
      her. This assurance comforted Luke a good deal; at the same time it made
      him more keenly alive to what was taking place, and he asked, suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be you a-going to give up the house then, mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, Luke&mdash;where be my means to keep it on?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to sell the bit o&rsquo; furniture?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what&rsquo;ll become o&rsquo; little Madlin?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peartree glanced uneasily at the child, who was seated on a footstool
      by her side; then motioning Luke to be silent, she said hurriedly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> look after Madlin, never fear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a day or so later, when Madeline was gone to school, Mrs. Peartree
      went on with the subject as if it had never been stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Madlin, Luke, and I&rsquo;ve decided to send her away
      too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! part wi&rsquo; Madlin?&rsquo; cried Luke, aghast, and for a moment it seemed to
      him that Mrs. Peartree was growing very hard-hearted, but when he looked
      up he saw that her eyes were dim with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, mate, part wi&rsquo; our Madlin,&rsquo; she said, sorrowfully. &lsquo;It a&rsquo;most broke
      my heart when I thought on&rsquo;t first, but I&rsquo;m past that now. &rsquo;Twill
      be for the child&rsquo;s good too. If she stopped wi&rsquo; us, she&rsquo;d get but a poor
      bringing-up at best, bless her; but if she goes to <i>him</i> he&rsquo;ll make a
      lady on her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Him, mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. White, that first brought her to us, and pays to this day for her
      keep. He&rsquo;s not her father, nor yet much kin of hers at all; but for all
      that he&rsquo;s a good gentleman, and will do his duty by her. We&rsquo;ll try him,
      anyways. If he takes her it will be a sore day for me, but a lucky chance
      for little Madlin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke listened quietly, and soon endorsed Aunt Jane&rsquo;s opinion, that
      the very best they could do for Madeline was to take her up to London and
      hand her over to the care of her natural guardian&mdash;the
      benevolent-looking gentleman who left her at the cottage when an infant,
      and had contributed to her maintenance ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let her know nothing about it, Luke,&rsquo; added Mrs. Peartree, &lsquo;or Lord
      only knows what she would do. After she&rsquo;s growed up, bless her, she&rsquo;d
      thank us for doin&rsquo; it, even if we could help it, which we can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of logic pleased Uncle Luke unmeasurably, and he went to bed
      tolerably contented with Aunt Jane&rsquo;s mode of working, and quite convinced
      that she was doing everything for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The succeeding days were very sad ones in the cottage, and though Madeline
      was almost overwhelmed with her grief for Uncle Mark, she could not help
      wandering at the strange conduct of those whom he had left behind. If she
      happened to come within arm&rsquo;s length of Aunt Jane she was certain to be
      caught up and kissed; if Uncle Luke&rsquo;s eye fell upon her, he burst into
      tears; at meal times she had three times too much food crammed upon her
      plate; if she approached the fire, her chair was drawn so close as to
      almost scorch her. But the crowning point came when she was told one
      morning that she was to go to London, for a day&rsquo;s &lsquo;outing&rsquo; with Uncle
      Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that Luke should take her. &lsquo;He had seen a good deal of the
      city,&rsquo; Mrs. Peartree said, &lsquo;and would do the errand better than she.&rsquo; Luke
      was quite contented, so it was settled forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her bereavement, Madeline could not help feeling glad at the
      thought of realising her dream at last. Childish griefs are not very
      enduring, and at another time a visit to London would have sent her mad
      with joy. But her pleasure was considerably damped when she saw Aunt Jane
      cry so, and Uncle Luke look so very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madlin, darlin&rsquo;,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Peartree, embracing her for the twentieth
      time, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a-going to see kind friends up in London; and maybe, if
      you&rsquo;re a good girl, they&rsquo;ll ask you to stay a bit, and see the wax-work,
      and all the fine sights. And if you stay, don&rsquo;t forget your Aunt Jane that
      brung you up, and loves you so dear&mdash;God bless&rsquo;ee, Madlin! God
      bless&rsquo;ee, and make a lady of ye&mdash;my own little darling gel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite bewildered, the child suffered herself to be led away by Uncle Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      After ferrying across the river and walking a mile, they reached the
      railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got into the train her contentment in a measure returned. She
      nestled up to Uncle Luke&rsquo;s side, stealing her little hand into his, and
      looked with rapture at the fields gliding past her so rapidly&mdash;at the
      river with its shining bends. As she went on her wonder deepened, and her
      excitement grew&mdash;for she passed little towns, then big stations
      covered with shining pictures, like palaces&mdash;until at length when she
      felt deep in Dreamland, they glided under a great arch of glass, and Uncle
      Luke, exclaiming &lsquo;Here we be,&rsquo; rose up and prepared to alight from the
      train.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;INTRODUCES A DISTINGUISHED LITERARY BOHEMIAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>till lost in
      wonder, Madeline alighted from the train, and, clutching Uncle Luke&rsquo;s
      hand, moved along with the crowd that was surging out of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once outside, amidst the din of rattling cabs and excited passengers,
      Uncle Luke seemed perplexed what to do next. He took off his high hat, and
      scratched his head; and this appeared to remind him that he had a paper
      carefully tucked into the hat&rsquo;s lining. So he searched for and found the
      paper, on which was written, in a round, clear hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmaduke White, Esq.,
    </p>
    <p>
      The Den,
    </p>
    <p>
      Willowtree Road,
    </p>
    <p>
      St. John&rsquo;s Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his perplexity he turned to a policeman, and, with his usual grin,
      showed him the paper. The policeman, who happened to be good-natured,
      informed him that he must walk across London Bridge, and make the best of
      his way to the Bank, where he would get an omnibus which would take him
      straight to his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you get to the Bank, look for a &ldquo;City Hatlas&rdquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;City
      Hatlas&rdquo; written on the outside. You can&rsquo;t go wrong.5
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus instructed, Uncle Luke toddled off as fast as his legs could carry
      him, and was swept along with the traffic that sets all day from London
      Bridge Station over the great Bridge. Madeline clung to him in amazement
      and terror, with her great wistful eyes wide in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed over the bridge and saw the river gleaming, she uttered a
      cry, and would have stopped to gaze, but her Uncle pulled her along, being
      far too excited for explanation or conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time they reached the Bank; and now a fresh perplexity occurred,
      for the little man had quite forgotten the policeman&rsquo;s directions.
      Madeline, however, remembered, and spying an omnibus labelled &lsquo;City Atlas&rsquo;
      hurried him towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed his paper to the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said that worthy; &lsquo;jump in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon they were well afloat in the great stream of London, with the
      waters roaring and mingling and crying around them. Madeline gazed out,
      and her wonder deepened as she saw the great shining shops, and the
      innumerable horses and vehicles, and the people ever coming and going,
      like waves of a sea. She thought it beautiful, a kind of terrible
      Fairyland, and it would have given her perfect pleasure if her heart had
      not been so full of a great grief. For the time being, indeed, she almost
      forgot her childish trouble in the strange new sense of a vast and
      troubled world, of whose mysterious motions she had never dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long ride, but it seemed only to occupy a few minutes. Uncle Luke
      was silent, crushed by his sorrow and by the situation; he held her hand
      tight, and fixed his poor sad eyes on vacancy, seeing and hearing nothing,
      only conscious that he had a task to perform, and determined, though his
      heart should break, that he would perform it to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they left the long thoroughfares behind and came out into a region
      comparatively green and countrified, with villas of all tastes and sizes
      ranged on either side of the road. Here the omnibus stopped, and the
      conductor told Uncle Luke to alight, announcing that they were at the
      corner of Willowtree Road, and that the address written on the paper must
      be close by. So Uncle Luke alighted with Madeline, paid their fare, and
      stood hesitating, while the omnibus rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willowtree Road consisted, from end to end, of detached and semi-detached
      villas, only variegated at two of the corners by public-houses. It was
      very quiet and suburban, and as all the trees in the gardens were already
      green, and many of them in flower, it looked quite rural and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paper in hand Uncle Luke trotted up and down for some time, in a vain
      search for the house he sought. The road was quite deserted, and there was
      no one whom he could consult. At last he came against a telegraph boy,
      sauntering along and whistling in the leisurely manner of those swift
      Mercuries of the period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from there,&rsquo; said Mercury, after inspecting the paper.
      &lsquo;You see that house with the verander? Well, you don&rsquo;t go up the front
      steps, but walk round to the side, and you&rsquo;ll see a bell marked &ldquo;Stoodio&rdquo;;
      ring that, and ask for Mr. White.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus directed, Uncle Luke approached the house, a small, semi-detached
      villa, and passing round, as directed, to the side, discovered with some
      little difficulty the bell in question. Without any hesitation, he rang.
      Scarcely had he done so, when the door opened as it were of its own
      accord, and he found himself in a dilapidated garden, face to face with a
      small building which looked like a diminutive Methodist chapel.
      Approaching the door of this edifice, he was about to knock, when his eyes
      fell upon a paper pasted upon it. On this paper was printed rather than
      written these words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. White out of town. Back this day week.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With Madeline&rsquo;s aid Uncle Luke spelt out the inscription, and it filled
      him with complete consternation. There being no date to the announcement,
      &lsquo;this day week&rsquo; was curiously indefinite, particularly as the paper showed
      signs of having been there for a considerable time already. While he stood
      gaping and scratching his head the studio door suddenly opened, and a very
      small boy with a very old face, clad in a very dirty page&rsquo;s uniform, made
      his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what is it&rsquo; cried this worthy, snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who do you want?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke took off his hat respectfully, and handed over the paper.
      Strange to say, the boy would not deign to inspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s the milk bill, you&rsquo;re to call again next week. If it&rsquo;s a summons,
      nobody ain&rsquo;t at home. Which of the gents is it for?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a-looking for Master White,&rsquo; said Uncle Luke, timidly, &lsquo;and if you
      please&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he don&rsquo;t please,&rsquo; answered the boy, with a fierce sense of grievance.
      &lsquo;He ain&rsquo;t at home. Didn&rsquo;t you see the paper on that there door?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture another head appeared in the background, and a pair of
      human eyes seemed rapidly to inspect the intruders. Then a voice said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Judas. Let &rsquo;em come in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus instructed, the page threw open the door, and Uncle Luke entered,
      with Madeline clinging to him. Their astonishment was considerable when
      they found themselves in a large apartment, lighted by glass windows from
      above, and full of all the paraphernalia of an artist&rsquo;s workshop&mdash;several
      easels, two or three lay figures, paintings in various states of
      completion. In one corner stood a stove, on the top of which was a loaf of
      brown bread and a tin coffee pot, and close to the stove was a perfect
      hecatomb of egg-shells. Indeed, what with general dust and debris of all
      kinds, the entire &lsquo;studio&rsquo; seemed sadly in need of cleaning out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fronting them as they entered was the only tenant of the apartment&mdash;a
      young man with a very light moustache, a watery blue eye, and a large
      amount of unkempt flaxen hair. He grasped a palette in one hand, a paint
      brush in the other, and in his mouth he held a black meerschaum pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it anything I can do for you?&rsquo; he said, with a rather vacant smile.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. Cheveley.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to see Master White,&rsquo; said Uncle Luke in a faltering voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      come all the way from the country, all along o&rsquo; Madlin, here. Haven&rsquo;t I,
      Madlin? If so be he&rsquo;s away, can&rsquo;t some one fetch him, and tell him Luke
      Peartree wants him, and that Uncle Mark&rsquo;s dead, and that poor Aunt Jane&rsquo;s
      a widder, and that things has all gone contrary, and all our hearts is
      broke?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears rose in Uncle Luke&rsquo;s eyes, and he stood choking, while Madeline
      clung to him and began crying too. The young man looked at them in
      astonishment for some minutes; then, struck by an idea, he walked rapidly
      to an inner door and cried loudly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, White.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sleepy voice answered from within&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one to see you&mdash;come, get up!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer seemed a combination of strong expressions, combined with
      inarticulate groans. After listening for a moment, Cheveley turned to
      Uncle Luke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, I say!&rsquo; he said, with the vacant helpless manner peculiar to him.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s writing in bed, and he won&rsquo;t rise. You&rsquo;d better go in and explain
      your own business. The little girl can wait here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not without some little fear and trembling, Uncle Luke released Madeline&rsquo;s
      hand, and moved with timid steps into the inner room. It was a very small
      chamber, furnished as a bedroom; that is to say, it contained an iron
      bedstead, a washstand, a table, and other conveniences. A chest of drawers
      gaping open was covered with articles of attire in most admired disorder,
      and other articles were hung on the walls or scattered about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perched up on the bed, with an embroidered smoking-cap on his head, was a
      gentleman in gold spectacles. He was writing rapidly with a pencil in a
      large manuscript book, and he scarcely looked up as Uncle Luke entered.
      But when Uncle Luke, whose heart was full and overflowed at the sight of
      one whom he believed to be a friend of the family, trotted over to the
      bedside and took his hand, crying like a child, he dropped his notebook
      and seemed aghast. Then, recognising his visitor, he questioned him, and
      soon knew the whole sad story&mdash;of Uncle Mark&rsquo;s accidental death, of
      the break-up of the little home, of the despair of the family, and their
      conviction that they could no longer do their duty by Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Madlin&rsquo;s here,&rsquo; cried Uncle Luke. &lsquo;I brung her, but, Lord, she don&rsquo;t
      guess <i>why</i> I brung her; she thinks she&rsquo;s a-going back. Oh, Mr.
      White, be a father to her! She ain&rsquo;t got ne&rsquo;er another, now her Uncle
      Mark&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo; Mr. White wiped his spectacles, and seemed utterly
      stupefied; at last he nodded, as if he had made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me those trousers,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute he had slipped into an old pair of tweed trousers, a
      pair of very dirty fancy slippers, and an old dressing-gown. Thus attired
      he even looked less engaging than when composing in bed. His hands were
      greatly in need of soap, his whiskers were ragged and ornamented with
      fragments of yolk of egg, and his face, which was otherwise kindly and
      good-humoured, looked parboiled. Seizing a brush, he went through the
      formality of brushing the very minute bunches of hair which ornamented his
      bald head, and then, after a momentary struggle with his whiskers, led the
      way into the &lsquo;studio.&rsquo; Here they found Madeline in high delight, for
      Cheveley, seizing a piece of charcoal, had dashed off a rough likeness of
      her on a canvas which stood vacant. The wild locks, the great wistful
      eyes, the delicate mouth, were happily caught, and for the moment the
      child forgot all her troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, Uncle Luke,&rsquo; she cried, running to him and pointing out the
      likeness. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke, still pale and trembling with his great grief, grinned from
      ear to ear, and gazed upon the artist in pathetic admiration. Meantime
      White stood blinking benignly through his spectacles; at last Madeline
      caught his look, and returned it with no little astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is Madlin,&rsquo; said Uncle Luke, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus introduced, Madeline dropped her eyes timidly, and gave a country
      curtsey, as she had been accustomed to do to the magnates of the village.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;UNCLE LUKE IS BROKEN-HEARTED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t appeared on
      explanation that the notice on the outside door of the &lsquo;studio&rsquo; was a
      common ruse of Mr. Marmaduke White whenever he desired perfect solitude,
      and when the visits of even friends and acquaintances, not to speak of
      ambassadors from certain adamantine creditors, would be considered
      irksome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although White dwelt in a studio, he was not an artist&mdash;not, that is
      to say, an artist by profession, though he could paint a little, and had a
      very pretty feeling for colour. By profession he was a man of letters; by
      special taste and habit, a writer for the theatre. Some of his less
      ambitious plays had been acted with no little <i>éclat</i>, and everybody
      had thriven through them except the author. Others had failed, and these
      failures constituted his glory. They were really productions of
      considerable literary merit. In literary circles White was spoken of as a
      man of genius whose mission it was to revive &lsquo;the poetical drama,&rsquo; but who
      had fallen on dark days, when the Muses, having discarded classic drapery
      altogether, had taken to fleshings and the <i>can-can</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a gentle creature, with as soft a heart as ever throbbed in human
      bosom, and as little power of managing his worldly affairs as of creating
      a profitable taste for dramas in &lsquo;five acts and in blank verse.&rsquo; He lived
      in a studio, with one artist or another for a companion, not because the
      place was necessary for his vocation, but because he was naturally a
      Bohemian, and a studio was a thoroughly Bohemian sort of abode. He was
      forty years of age, unmarried, and unlikely to marry. The number of his
      follies could only have been measured by the number of his good deeds, and
      those were legion. To see him was to like him; to know him was to love him
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years past he had paid a small stipend&mdash;not much, but a sharp
      pinch sometimes to him&mdash;for the maintenance of Madeline. The way in
      which he had contracted this responsibility was characteristic, and may at
      once be explained. A friend of his who was a &lsquo;genius&rsquo;&mdash;that is to
      say, an individual who promised prodigies, and on the strength of his
      promises, which were never fulfilled, discarded all conventional morality
      and lived the life of a shabby Don Juan&mdash;had become entangled with a
      country girl. Dying penitent, as well as penniless, he confided to White,
      who watched by his sick bed like a woman, that he had betrayed the girl,
      and that she had given birth to a child, then about one year old. White
      promised that he would seek both mother and child, and help them if
      possible. So after putting his poor friend into the ground, and moving
      heaven and earth to get a few tender things about him inserted in the
      newspapers, White betook himself to the lonely seaside village where the
      widow dwelt. He found a comely but ignorant girl in a state of comparative
      destitution, and, to make matters worse, in the last stage of consumption,
      brought on by exposure and neglect, In the course of the interviews which
      ensued, he learned such things of his dead friend&rsquo;s treacherous and
      selfish conduct as would have shaken his faith in genius altogether had he
      been less simple-hearted. A little later the girl died in his arms, giving
      him her last blessing and consigning her little daughter to his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      After considerable reflection, he decided that the best course he could
      adopt with the little one was to find some good motherly soul, in the
      mother&rsquo;s sphere of life, who would rear her kindly. During an artistic
      excursion to Grayfleet he discovered Mrs. Peartree, and, after certain
      pecuniary preliminaries were arranged, committed the child to her care.
      What had been originally only a temporary arrangement presently became
      fixed and habitual. Years passed away. Madeline remained with the
      Peartrees, who were childless. White, in a very irregular manner, sent
      them small sums from time to time; but it had never occurred to him to
      take any more serious responsibility in the matter. He meant the girl to
      grow up happy in the sphere to which her mother belonged. Though he had
      beheld her once or twice in infancy, he had for years afterwards seen
      nothing of her, only hearing of her existence through correspondence from
      time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, Uncle Luke turned up in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, with Madeline
      under his charge, and explained that sad events had broken up the little
      home and left Madeline helpless on their hands, White was staggered. It
      was clear that the Peartrees thought him her natural guardian, and could
      not comprehend that he stood in no closer relationship to her than they
      did themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Madeline, and was astonished to see her so fair and elf-like,
      with a touch in her eyes of his poor dead friend, the literary Bohemian.
      Somehow or other he had always pictured her as a fat little country
      cherub, with very hard cheeks, a pug nose, and ugly feet. As she gazed at
      him with her great blue eyes, he felt troubled more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t remember poor Fred Hazelmere?&rsquo; he said to Cheveley. &lsquo;No, he was
      gone before your time. But you&rsquo;ve read his &ldquo;Ballads of Bohemia&rdquo;&mdash;by
      Jove, sir, some of them are worthy of the &ldquo;Buch der Lieder.&rdquo;&rsquo; And he added
      in a whisper, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s his child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had led Cheveley aside, and was conversing with him apart, while
      Madeline and Uncle Luke sat waiting in the centre of the studio. &lsquo;Look at
      her face,&rsquo; he proceeded. &lsquo;Never saw such a likeness in my life&mdash;it
      quite turns me over. She looks a wild little thing, don&rsquo;t she? The man
      with her is a sort of natural. It was absurd to think of sending her to
      me, for what on earth can I do with her? <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not her father, after
      all. Upon my soul, I&rsquo;m in a dilemma. I must persuade him to take her
      back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when White took Uncle Luke aside and tried to explain matters to him,
      the little man only began to cry. The home was broken up, he said; Aunt
      Jane&rsquo;s only means of subsistence was to go out as a monthly nurse; and he
      himself was going to join a distant relation on the coast of Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t that we want to lose her,&rsquo; he asseverated; &lsquo;but oh, Master
      White, there be no home for Madlin now. Our hearts be broke, sir, to part
      wi&rsquo; her; but we know you&rsquo;re next door to her father, and a gentleman born.
    </p>
    <p>
      She&rsquo;ll be a heap better off here than ever she was along of us.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here?&rsquo; gasped the dramatist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s your&rsquo;n, sir, more than our&rsquo;n, bless her heart. We couldn&rsquo;t feed her
      no more, let alone clothe her, now Mark&rsquo;s gone to glory; but you&rsquo;re a
      gentleman born, and can bring her up well-nigh like a lady. I brung her,
      Master White,&rsquo; he continued, reverting to his first fear; &lsquo;but I dustn&rsquo;t
      let her know I&rsquo;m a-going to leave her&mdash;I dustn&rsquo;t, indeed. She thinks
      she&rsquo;s a-going back with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t take her!&rsquo; exclaimed White. &lsquo;This is no place for a child,
      and even if it were she needs a woman&rsquo;s care. I really can&rsquo;t think of it;
      the very idea&rsquo;s absurd.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke looked astonished. In his simple judgment, the power of a
      &lsquo;gentleman born,&rsquo; like Mr. White, was unlimited, and he could not fathom
      the significance of his refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s that good,&rsquo; he explained gently, &lsquo;that she&rsquo;d be no manner o&rsquo;
      trouble to any, &rsquo;cept when she&rsquo;s in her tantrums, and they&rsquo;re gone
      as soon as come. And she&rsquo;s clever, Master White. I&rsquo;ve heerd schoolmaster
      say that she can spell like a good &rsquo;un, and her writin&rsquo;s as clear
      as print. I see her write out the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer on a piece of paper, and
      she guv it to her Uncle Mark, and if he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; lived, he was a-going to get
      it framed like a pictur&rsquo; and hung up on the cabin of the barge.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This special pleading had little or no effect on White. He was puzzling
      his brain what to do. Once or twice he thought of repudiating the
      responsibility altogether, but he was far too good-natured for that. Then
      he suggested that Luke should take the child back and leave him to think
      it over, but he soon discovered that such a delay was impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother said,&rsquo; explained Uncle Luke, firmly (his sister-in-law, it will be
      remembered, had always been addressed as &lsquo;mother&rsquo; by her husband, and by
      all the house)&mdash;&lsquo;mother said I was to leave her along o&rsquo; you, cause
      you was her best friend; and mother said you&rsquo;d never grudge her the
      wittles what she eat, for you were a gentleman born. Them were her own
      words. You&rsquo;d never grudge her the wittles what she eat, for you was a
      gentleman born.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old is she?&rsquo; asked White, desperately, not that he had any special
      reason for asking, but because, in his perplexity, he hardly knew what to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke cocked his eye, calculating, and after due deliberation replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother says it be just eight year come Whit-Monday since you brung her to
      us. She remembers the year well, mother does, &rsquo;cause &rsquo;twas
      the year when her cousin Jim he was drowned off Woolwich Pier, after he
      had deserted and was running away for his precious life; and they held a
      &rsquo;quest upon him, and said he was drownded accidental, and had
      hisself to blame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Between eight and nine years old,&rsquo; muttered White, pursuing his own
      feeble reflections. &lsquo;Is there no place where she could be put? No person
      who, for a small consideration, would take her in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke shook his head dolefully. He had never questioned for a moment
      but that White would give the child a welcome, and he was quite incapable
      of conceiving the manifold objections there might be to her immediate
      adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were at this juncture when Madame de Bemy, who occupied the
      adjoining house, and from whom White rented the studio, came in smiling.
      She was a stout little old lady, with a very profound respect for her
      tenant, who had been useful to her in many ways, as indeed he was almost
      invariably to everybody with whom he came in close contact. To his
      surprise she cut the Gordian knot by offering to take care of the child on
      White&rsquo;s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Madeline had been listening with growing suspicion. At last
      the whole truth dawned upon her, and she burst into lamentation. Clinging
      to Uncle Luke, she cried that she would never leave him, and that she
      would return to Grayfleet in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an exciting scene, over which we have no intention to linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke did not depart that night. They made him up a bed in the corner
      of the studio, where he lay awake till morning, weeping and wondering, but
      still firm in his desire to see Madeline made into a little lady. The
      child herself was taken care of by Madame de Berny. But she would not
      depart from the studio until Uncle Luke had avowed positively that he
      would be there, waiting for her, in the morning. His simple promise
      satisfied her, for never in all her life had she known him to break his
      word.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;MADELINE FINDS NEW FRIENDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next day Uncle
      Luke went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words would fail us to describe the parting. The little man wept like a
      child, and Madeline threw herself, again and again, into his arms, in a
      perfect frenzy of passion. It was terrible to see so fierce a storm
      shaking the fragile form of so young a child. Madame de Berny led her,
      sobbing, into the house, and tried in vain to give her consolation; but
      for hours upon hours she wept wildly, and her little heart seemed broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Marmaduke White was utterly at a loss how to act; but he had
      resolved, come what might, to accept his burthen and bear it as well as he
      could. Every look, every gesture of the child, especially during her
      fierce access of sorrow, reminded him more and more of his dead friend.
      Her weird and elf-like beauty, moreover, appealed to his strong artistic
      sense. Yes, he would do what he could for her, and trust to that
      Providence which feeds the literary raven to find him ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his perplexity he found an excellent adviser in Madame de Berny.
      The good woman, who had a large heart for children, entered cordially into
      his wishes, and at the end of a long consultation readily undertook the
      charge of Madeline for the time being. She had plenty of leisure on her
      hands, the Chevalier de Berny, her husband, a professor of music, being
      from home, teaching, all day, while her only daughter, an actress at the
      Pall Mall Theatre, was engaged every evening, and nearly every day, in the
      pursuit of the business and the pleasures of her profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was speedily settled, and Madeline was soon installed, as an
      informal boarder, in the De Berny household, having a little room upstairs
      next to the gorgeous chamber occupied by Mademoiselle Mathilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief of childhood heals quickly, and with childhood&rsquo;s inquisitiveness
      Madeline was soon busy observing the manners and customs of her new
      friends. Though her heart was still wild and weary, and though every night
      she sobbed as she thought of her happy home at Grayfleet, hers was too
      quick and keen a nature to be quite deadened by its sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Madame de Berny was very kind; even Aunt Jane could not have been
      kinder. As to the Chevalier, who came in late at night and departed very
      early in the morning, she found him a fat, fretful, overworked, but
      naturally good-hearted little Frenchman, who spent the whole of his one
      leisure day, Sunday, in smoking a big pipe and reading the French
      journals. But the queen of the dwelling was Mathilde, a tall, thin blonde,
      with golden hair, very fine eyes, and a very hard mouth. She dressed very
      loudly and used a great deal of paint and powder; her whole style, indeed,
      was &lsquo;fast,&rsquo; and, though she was a Frenchman&rsquo;s daughter, her conversation
      and all her ideas were vulgarly suggestive of Cockaigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her character, however, was unimpeachable; she was far too calculating and
      worldly wise to commit herself in any way. Her parents adored her. She had
      the best room in the house, a little study also where she conned her
      parts, and these were as the sanctuary of a saint. The Chevalier was
      firmly convinced that she was only prevented by the malice and wickedness
      of the world from becoming recognised as a great actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My daughter is too good,&rsquo; he would say to his friends; &lsquo;it is her virtue
      which keeps her back. If she vere like de rest of de vomen on your stage,
      it would be different&mdash;<i>ah ciel</i>, yes I De managers are in a
      conspiracy to give her bad parts and to break her leetel heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mathilde herself was of the same opinion. Her face was quite worn and
      haggard with brooding over her professional wrongs, her heart torn daily
      by the success of her rivals and the real or fancied neglect of the
      public. Once or twice a week she had violent fits of hysteria, during
      which she would think and talk of suicide. Recovering from these, she
      would eat a hearty dinner and drink large quantities of bottled stout&mdash;to
      which she was very partial, chiefly because it was said to be fattening,
      and her enemies in the stalls considered her too lean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of Madeline, who had hitherto only known the coarse beauties
      of Grayfleet, Mathilde was a vision of loveliness. The child loved colour
      and splendour and beauty, and Mathilde seemed to represent all these. The
      actress&rsquo;s bedroom, too, was like a palace of enchantment, with its
      delicate rose-coloured curtains, its white French bed and bedding, its
      bright carpet, and its delicious perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathilde was not particularly fond of children, but homage from any one
      pleased her, and thus it happened that Madeline became a constant visitor
      in the sanctuary. When, one day, Mathilde opened her wardrobe and showed
      all her magnificent costumes, both those she used in private life and
      those she reserved for the theatre, the bliss of the sight was almost too
      much to bear. It was like a glimpse of heaven itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the weeks passed away, and the new strange life was growing gradually
      familiar. The thought of the little Grayfleet home was still bright in the
      child&rsquo;s mind, and every night she said a prayer that Uncle Luke had taught
      her, and every night she cried when she went over the beloved names, but
      her spirit was kindled into a new kind of feverish activity, such as she
      had never been conscious of before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of her daily visits to the studio, where even the
      misanthropic Judas, as he had been profanely christened on account of his
      forbidding aspect, now gave her a welcome, she saw many things which
      awakened her wonder. Her previous ideas of Art had been chiefly connected
      with house-decoration and sign-painting, and she marvelled much at the
      creations on canvas of young Mr. Cheveley. For White she soon contracted a
      passionate affection, which deepened into idolatry when the good-natured
      Bohemian began, in his idle moments, to teach her to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quickness with which she learned the rudiments of this accomplishment
      reminded White that her general education was being neglected altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; he said to her one afternoon, 41 think I shall have to send you
      to school.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing at his side, looking over his shoulder, as he &lsquo;touched
      up&rsquo; for her a picture of a house which reeled to one side like the leaning
      tower at Pisa, a tree or two like inverted mops, and a very shabby-looking
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him right in the eyes, which was her custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate school,&rsquo; she said emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So did I at your age, and the child who doesn&rsquo;t always comes to be hung.
      But I really think you&rsquo;d pay for a little schooling. You write a shocking
      hand, to begin with.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Luke said it was <i>beau</i>tiful writing, and as clear as print.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph! well, you see, he looked at it from a different point of view. I
      don&rsquo;t question its legibility, which after all is the first thing to be
      aimed at, but it wants style. Then, your grammar is more shady than befits
      the protégée of a master-stylist, like myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s grammar?&rsquo; asked Madeline, swinging her right foot irritably.
      &lsquo;Nouns, verbs, &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;thou art,&rdquo; and all that? I hate &rsquo;em all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White laid down the drawing on which he had been busy, and took her by the
      two hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hate a good many things,&rsquo; he said mildly. &lsquo;Pray, what do you
      particularly like?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like drawing. I like to hear Mamzelle singing the pretty songs, and
      trying on her new dresses. I like dancing, too, and music, and all that.
      And I like to be here with <i>you</i>. I like you better than Mr.
      Cheveley. If I was big enough I&rsquo;d <i>marry</i> you, and then you could
      take me to the theayter, where Mamzelle goes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pronounce it theatre,&rsquo; said White, while his eyes opened in amused
      wonder. &lsquo;So you are beginning to think of marrying already, are you?
      Precocious child! And you&rsquo;d marry <i>me</i>, would you? Why, I&rsquo;m old
      enough to be your father, and by the time you are a young woman I shall be
      quite on the shelf.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline surveyed him for some moments critically; then she threw her arms
      round his neck and kissed him impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I marry you, Mr. White,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a nice wig, and
      then, you see, no one will know!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wig&mdash;the gods forbid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A beautiful <i>black</i>, like the Chevalier wears. I know it&rsquo;s a wig,
      because he takes it off and puts on a nightcap when he goes to bed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White threw back his head and laughed heartily; then forcing a serious
      look into his face, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us wander from the subject; I began by saying that you must go
      to school.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline&rsquo;s face darkened, and her lips pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Madeline! Don&rsquo;t you care to learn?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevertheless, learning is a physic which you will be compelled to take.
      You mustn&rsquo;t grow up a little ignoramus. English grammar, geography, and&mdash;yes,
      by Jove&mdash;you shall learn French and music.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;French!&rsquo; she cried, with a sudden sparkle in her eyes. &lsquo;Like Mamzelle
      talks sometimes to her pa?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And music! I love music! And then I shall understand every word they say,
      and play like Mamzelle on the piano. Oh, Mr. White, do let me go to school
      and learn French and music!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All. opposition being thus speedily withdrawn, White determined that
      Madeline should go to school forthwith. In his customary fashion,
      therefore, he dismissed the subject from his mind; and it is a question
      how soon he would have practically carried out the scheme if Madeline
      herself had not worried him every day with the question, &lsquo;Oh, Mr. White,
      when am I to go to school and learn French and music?&rsquo; But after a
      consultation with the Chevalier, a school was found in the neighbourhood&mdash;which
      he himself attended two or three times a week&mdash;and after a slight
      discussion over terms, which were specially reduced in her case, Madeline
      was sent there as a day scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice since her translation to London, Madeline had heard from her
      foster-mother, who was then going from house to house as a monthly nurse.
      Mrs. Peartree could not write herself, but she sent by deputy many fond
      and loving messages, which Madeline answered with letters a thousand times
      more passionate. Since the day of their parting, however, she had heard
      nothing from Uncle Luke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some few weeks after she went to school there arrived a letter for her
      bearing the post-mark of a small town in Essex. Opening it eagerly, she
      read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mi dere Madlin,&mdash;This comes from uncle Luke, hopping you are quite
      wel and a good gel which it leaves me at present. I be ni art-broke far
      away from you and mother working on the river down alonger mi cussin Joss
      don&rsquo;t kry cos I brung you to London but be a good gel and give my umble
      respecs to Mister wite mi dere Madlin mi dere Madlin there be no bargis in
      thes parts and neer a brethren but aples be pourful big and I wish you see
      the aple-tree in cussin Joss his garding with luv &amp; kisses &amp;
      hopping you are a good gel &amp; my humble respecks to mister wito good bi
      at present I am ever fecksonit uncle luke peartree.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>P.S. Be a good gel &amp; don&rsquo;t kri cos I brung you.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and many a burning kiss did Madeline press on this simple epistle.
      She wetted it with her most tender tears, and placed it beneath her pillow
      at night, and carried it about all day in her bosom, to be kissed and
      kissed yet again. With a certain intuitive shame, she did not show it to
      any member of the De Berny family, whose fault was a snobbishness
      characteristic of shabby gentility, but she fearlessly confided in Mr.
      White and let him read it through. He was touched by its simple affection,
      penetrating through the rude orthography to the staunch and loving soul of
      the writer; and he encouraged the girl to talk to him of Uncle Luke and
      all her lowly friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those who did not know him,&rsquo; he thought, as he listened to her eager
      words and watched her flushed face, &lsquo;called poor Fred callous. It&rsquo;s a lie!
      He had a noble heart, and so, thank God, has his little child!&rsquo;

      later, as White sat alone in the studio working at the scenario of a new
      play, the door was thrown open and in rushed Madeline. Her hair was
      dishevelled, her dress disordered, her whole face distorted with passion.
      Before he had time to speak she threw herself on a sofa and burst into an
      agony of tears.

    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! take me home; let me go back to Grayfleet!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White took her hand softly, and spoke to her soothingly, but his
      gentleness only made her worse. At last he yielded to his irritation and
      insisted on an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drying her eyes she sat up and looked at him, and he was startled by the
      white determination in her delicate face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you not at school?&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I&rsquo;ve left, and I&rsquo;ll never go back to school again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s true, and I want to go home, I won&rsquo;t stay here, and I won&rsquo;t go back
      to school.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what has happened?7
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline gave a wild hysterical laugh, and her face assumed an expression
      of exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I struck her in the face, Mr. White, and I pulled down her hair, and when
      she saw I was angry she was frightened and screamed. If I had been
      stronger, I would have killed her&mdash;I would! I would!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Completely perplexed by this enigmatical tirade, White quietly took his
      hat and walked off to the young ladies&rsquo; seminary, which was only a few
      streets away. Arrived there, he found everything in commotion and the lady
      superintendent highly indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, on explanation, that Madeline, for some reason unexplained,
      had, during the midday play hour, made a savage attack upon a young lady
      of sixteen, a parlour boarder excellently connected; had sprung upon her
      with fury, scratched her face, and had clung to her until torn away by
      force. The superintendent&rsquo;s mind was made up: Madeline must not return to
      the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a very violent child. I have again and again had to rebuke her for
      fits of passion. I have now discovered, moreover, that her connections are
      not what I should wish in members of my seminary. Miss de Castro, whom she
      assaulted, is a sweet girl, incapable of provocation. Her papa is in the
      India Office. She is niece of Sir Michael de Castro, late Governor of
      Chickerabad, and I cannot have her assaulted by a common child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White stared silently at the lady, and without a word strode back to the
      studio. There, with a severity unusual to him, he demanded a full
      explanation. He thus learned that the <i>fons et origo</i> of all the
      mischief was Uncle Luke&rsquo;s letter. By some accident it had fallen from
      Madeline&rsquo;s bosom and been picked up by Miss de Castro. That &lsquo;sweet girl&rsquo;
      had read it through to a group of the elder pupils, doing full justice to
      the orthography, and mimicking, as far as she could imagine them, the
      living manners of the writer. In the midst of her amusement, Madeline had
      appeared and demanded her property, which Miss de Castro immediately
      thrust behind her back, while she indulged in a series of witticisms at
      the expense of Madeline and all her relations, especially the country
      correspondent. This was enough. Almost before she herself knew it Madeline
      was at her throat, and in a white heat of passion. The sweet girl
      screamed. Madeline was torn away and thrust violently out of the
      school-yard gate, but not before she had recovered her uncle&rsquo;s letter and
      thrust it into her bosom. Then she had flown home.
    </p>
    <p>
      White was greatly perplexed how to act. In his secret heart he sided with
      the child, and cursed the cruelty of ignorance and caste; but he
      nevertheless perceived that fits of passion and violence were not to be
      encouraged. So he frowned terribly, and read Madeline a long and stern
      lecture on the wickedness of giving up to wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him out with great attention, and with her great eyes fixed
      pathetically on his. At the conclusion of the harangue, she took out Uncle
      Luke&rsquo;s letter and quietly kissed it&mdash;then smiled faintly through her
      tears at the thought of her wrongs. It was clear that she was quite
      impenitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not go back to school. For some months she remained at home
      with the De Bernys; White, in his indolent way, postponing the question of
      where she was to go next.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a good deal occupied at this time with the adaptation of a new play
      which was being acted with great success at the Porte St. Martin, and, as
      it was necessary to see the play represented by the French actors, he
      spent some weeks in Paris. He discovered that by carefully lopping the
      leading idea, making the chief female virtuous instead of vicious,
      altering the scenes, and turning the moral upside down, he could make the
      great drama pure enough for the sight of the British playgoer. His English
      manager approved, sent him a small cheque on account, and begged him &lsquo;to
      do the trick&rsquo; as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period, therefore, Madeline was thrown more and more into the
      society of Mademoiselle Mathilde. That vision of loveliness found the
      child useful, sent her on endless errands, made of her a sort of companion
      in miniature, and extempore lady&rsquo;s maid. Madeline was only too delighted
      to serve and worship, and great was her joy when any of the cast-off
      splendour fell to her share. One evening Madame de Berny took her to the
      theatre, on the occasion of her daughter&rsquo;s &lsquo;benefit.&rsquo; There was a
      serio-comedy in which Mathilde played the leading part, and a burlesque to
      follow, in which (for that occasion only, for she generally despised
      burlesque) she enacted a fairy prince. Madeline was entranced; the spell
      of the footlights came upon her once and for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, after they had returned home, and the Vision had supped well
      on oysters and bottled stout, Madeline proffered a request which had
      lately become a very common one with her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mamzelle, let me brush your hair!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathilde took a sleepy sensuous pleasure in that part of her toilette, and
      would sit by the hour together under the soothing manipulation of the
      brush. So she let down her golden locks, and placed herself, with her eyes
      half closed, before the mirror, while Madeline began her task, prattling
      between whiles of the theatre, of all the wonders she had seen, and of the
      longing that would possess her until she saw them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to feel like you once,&rsquo; yawned Mathilde, &lsquo;when I was a dear little
      thing, with my hair growing down to my waist, and little satin shoes on my
      feet, and Pa used to take me to the pantomimes. Ah, dear, that&rsquo;s over and
      done. I hate the theatre.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hate it, Mamzelle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and sometimes I hate Pa for ever letting me go nigh to it. I suppose
      it all comes of Ma marrying a Frenchman; for Pa used to teach me to say
      those long speeches in rhyme out of the French plays, and then I got a
      taste for recitation. But I hate French now, and I hate the theatre. It&rsquo;s
      nothing but worry and vexation. There was only five pounds ten in the
      stalls to-night besides the tickets Pa and Ma sold, and the dress circle
      was not half full. Did you notice a dark fat man in a private box, who
      threw a bouquet to Miss Harlington?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean a gentleman with a hook nose, Mamzelle, and his fingers all
      over big rings?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Well, that was Isaacs, proprietor of the &ldquo;Evening Scrutator.&rdquo; A
      nasty beast, always smelling of cigars and rum-and-water. He hates me
      because I keep myself respectable, and he never suffers any one of his
      critics to say a good word about me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are <i>they</i>, Mamzelle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The critics? Tomfools who write in the papers, and don&rsquo;t know good acting
      from bad, and if they did daren&rsquo;t say so. Why, they praise Miss Harlington&mdash;who
      played &ldquo;Princess Pretty pet&rdquo; in the burlesque!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; cried Madeline, in rapture. &lsquo;Her in the pink dress with the
      spangles and the flowers in her hair. Oh, wasn&rsquo;t she lovely, Mamzelle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathilde tossed her head under the brush, and flushed With virtuous
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bandy-legged thing with a voice like a goat. Did you hear the creature
      sing? I wonder they don&rsquo;t hiss her off the stage. But the men run after
      her, and she&rsquo;s kept by an earl; and there she is every day in her
      victoria, driving in the Row among real ladies, while I must go down to
      rehearsal in the bus. It&rsquo;s disgusting&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is. Do take
      care. Madeline&mdash;you&rsquo;re brushing it all the wrong way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She added as an afterthought, less in real consideration for her hearer
      than as a parade of her own wrongs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never you be an actress, child. Sweep a crossing first, or serve behind a
      counter, or do anything dreadful. The stage isn&rsquo;t fit for any decent
      person, and so I&rsquo;ve told Pa and Ma a thousand times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From this and from many other similar conversations, and from several
      subsequent visits to the theatre, both before and behind the scenes,
      Madeline began to acquire a precocious insight into some of the mysteries
      of life in London. She was clever and quick, and soon understood as much
      as was comprehensible to so pure a child. Mathilde de Berny, like many of
      her class, talked freely about things which might well have been nameless,
      and never seemed to reflect that the listener was so young. Fortunately,
      Madeline&rsquo;s perfect innocence and simplicity, combined with her real
      strength of character, kept her pure from taint; but by slow degrees the
      glory was beginning to depart from the great world of which she knew so
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all too soon White saw that Madeline was in danger of degeneration.
      He was a shrewd fellow, and understood that Mathilde de Berny, though a
      perfectly virtuous young woman, was not really the best companion she
      could have found. It irritated him too, at last, to see the child sinking
      into a mere appendage of the actress and general drudge of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must get her away,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;before they spoil her
      altogether. They neglect her and impose upon her, and teach her things she
      ought not to know. I don&rsquo;t want Fred&rsquo;s child to grow into a little
      slattern, with the education, and perhaps the moral instinct, of a
      ballet-girl. They make a small parasite of her, and she goes errands;
      they&rsquo;ve even got in the habit of sending her for the beer. I&rsquo;ll put a stop
      to it at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way of putting a stop to it was to send Madeline to a
      boarding-school; and this he ultimately determined to do. He had begun to
      feel quite a paternal interest in her, and he was more and more struck by
      her physical beauty and strong natural affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seeking about for some time, and studying the advertising columns of
      the daily newspapers, he discovered a quiet school at Merton, in Surrey,
      under the superintendence of a very superior French lady. Hither it was
      arranged that Madeline should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after a fond parting with White, Madeline repaired to the seminary at
      Merton.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time after her departure White was melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He missed her bright face and her loving ways; and so, in a less degree,
      did his companion of the studio. But White was a busy man, part of a busy
      world, and he had no time to be heartbroken about a little girl. Every
      month or so he received a formal account of her doings, signed by the
      superintendent, and still oftener a very effusive and loving letter from
      Madeline herself. She appeared to have become resigned very rapidly to the
      new conditions of her life; to be sanguine and full of promise; and the
      official notes of her educational progress were flattering in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, our business with Madeline&rsquo;s childhood ceases. We take the
      dramatist&rsquo;s licence, and at one leap pass over a period of several years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school was in connection with a similar one in Normandy, and the
      pupils had the advantage of being transferred, at a certain stage of their
      progress, and at little additional expense, to the French establishment.
      The superintendent was a sensible woman, and so White told her the whole
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was presently decided that it would be for Madeline&rsquo;s advantage to go
      to France for a year, without seeing anything of White or any of her new
      friends. She was still only a very rough diamond, and needed very
      considerable polishing to make her approach perfection. A long period
      spent in pleasant discipline, and with only the most refined surroundings,
      was absolutely essential to her moral development. So at least thought the
      lady superintendent; and White agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving the information that she was to be again transplanted,
      Madeline was in high grief and dudgeon, for she had been thoroughly happy
      with the De Bernys, and desired no better than to become again a kind of
      Cinderella to the fair Mathilde.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her residence at Merton Marmaduke White has been fairly well
      satisfied with his ward. Beyond complaints of certain erratic habits, and
      of her general disposition to act from passionate impulse, he had heard
      little to her detriment, much to her credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen her from time to time, and she had spent many of her holidays
      at Willowtree Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the tone of her letters, and from her words when they met, he
      gathered that she was happy. She had gained the wish of her heart; had
      learnt &lsquo;French and music,&rsquo; as well as the other elegances which constitute
      a good education.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Madeline was sent to Normandy, with a contingent of young girls from
      the school at Merton.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when nearly eighteen months had elapsed since their last meeting,
      White received a photograph from France. It represented a fair maiden,
      with great wistful eyes, and a face of singular beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he scarcely knew it; then he turned it over, and read in a bold
      handwriting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Madeline Hasleere, taken at Rouen on her 17th birthday.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little Madeline!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Why, she looks quite a woman!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About a week after this event, Judas (now grown into a disjointed being of
      seventeen or eighteen) entered with a telegram. White opened it, and saw
      with astonishment that it was from Madame Brock, the lady superintendent
      of the school at Merton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Please come down at once. I have had terrible news from Millefleurs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Your ward, Madeline Haslemere, has run away. I fear it is an elopement.</i>
    </p>

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;THE HAWK AND THE DOVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he scene of our
      story changes for a time from smoky London to a lonely road close to the
      sea-coast of Normandy. It is the sunset of a rainy day, a fierce red light
      beats down on the yellow colza fields, sprinkled with great bells of
      crimson poppy; on the deep, wind-swept patches of yellow wheat; on the
      little villages embowered in foliage, each with its old-fashioned auberge
      and its glittering spire.
    </p>
    <p>
      An open post-chaise, drawn by a pair of heavy horses, is flying seaward,
      towards the marine town of Fécamp. Side by side within it sit two figures,
      a very young lady, wrapped in a fur-lined silk cloak, and a tall,
      haggard-looking man of thirty, with very long hair and a jet-black
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and again the man leans forward and urges on the driver, then,
      after a quick glance on the road, which winds far away behind them, he
      sinks back upon his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They halt and change horses in a quaint little village, where old women
      and maidens ply their antique spinning-wheels at the cottage doors, and
      blue-bloused loungers puff their <i>sous</i> cigars on wooden forms before
      the auberge. They do not alight, but the gentleman brings the lady a tiny
      glass of the liqueur called &lsquo;Bénédictin,&rsquo; and some wine biscuits. She sips
      the liqueur and breaks a biscuit, while the loungers in blue blouses look
      on in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady is very pale, and looks so young that the loungers whisper
      wonderingly at each other. Now and then her lip quivers, and her eyes fill
      with tears. The gentleman with her watches her anxiously, trying to
      anticipate every look and wish, but she scarcely looks at him&mdash;her
      thoughts are far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How far to Fécamp?&rsquo; the gentleman asks of the ostler, as he slips the <i>pour-boire</i>
      into his hand; and when he finds that it is still many kilometres away,
      and that it is impossible to reach it in less than three or four hours, he
      mutters an imprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a quick, cat-like look in his eyes, as he converses with the
      world at large; but when he turns to his companion the look is exchanged
      for one of touching humility and sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are ready to start again, the driver is in his place, when the young
      lady springs up and cries in French, &lsquo;Arrêtez!&rsquo; The gentleman, who is
      again seated by her side, looks at her in astonishment, &lsquo;Madeline! <i>mon
      ange!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She answers him in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not too late&mdash;let us turn and go back. I am sorry now I came
      away. Monsieur Belleisle, I <i>insist</i> on turning back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Mais non!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame Collemache will forgive me&mdash;I will go upon my knees and ask
      her&mdash;Madame is a good woman. Oh, why did you ask me to do anything so
      foolish? Look how these people are staring! Turn back at once!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at a sign from the gentleman, the driver has started off, and they
      are soon leaving the village at full gallop. To comfort her, Monsieur
      slips his hand round her waist. He is not prepared for the result, which
      came in the shape of a sharp slap in the face from the little gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dare you? I will not be pulled about, and I will go back to Madame.
      If you are a gentleman you will take me back at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur rubs his cheek and tries to smile, but there is an angry light in
      his eyes nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are cruel, and I&mdash;ah, how I love you! Have you not promised to
      be my little wife? Mine own Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is about to embrace her again, but the look in her face deters him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was angry with Madame because I thought her cruel and unjust. She made
      me mad, and so I listened to you. Drive me back, Monsieur, and I will like
      you very much. I will take all the blame upon myself&mdash;only drive me
      back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak so,&rsquo; is the reply. &lsquo;We love each other&mdash;we will be
      happy&mdash;ah, so happy&mdash;-with one another. Madeline! my bride!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have changed my mind. I will not marry you, Monsieur Belleisle!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ah ciel</i>, you do not mean what you say!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do mean it. Why should I marry you? I do not like you. I shall hate you
      soon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is too late to say that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is true.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I will not beliefe it! You are triste&mdash;the journey make you
      triste and fatiguée&mdash;to-morrow you will smile again upon your own
      Auguste.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rsquo; answered the young lady. &lsquo;I liked you very
      well when you gave me my lessons, and last night in my anger, in my
      wickedness, I thought I would come with you, because I wished to be
      revenged on Madame and Mademoiselle Blanche. But now I have repented,
      Monsieur. I was a little fool, and I will beg their pardon. They have been
      very kind to me. I was ungrateful. I will return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this in an impetuous stream, half soliloquy, half entreaty. In her
      passion and excitement the girl looks very lovely, and the Frenchman gazes
      at her in growing admiration. Then a thought seems to strike him, and he
      looks at her slyly and smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you laughing, Monsieur?&rsquo; she cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was thinking, <i>mignonne</i>, how ridiculous you would look if you
      returned. Ah, Dieu, how they would <i>laugh!</i>&rsquo; This is a move in the
      right direction. The young lady cannot bear ridicule, and she frowns at
      the very thought of it. For some minutes she seems plunged in bitter
      reflection; then she speaks again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I am not afraid,&rsquo; she cries; &lsquo;I do not fear any but Madame, and when
      I have apologised she will take my part. Oh, why did I come with you? why
      did I think of running away?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you love me, <i>mon ange!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Love you, Monsieur Belleisle? I like you better than Herr Bunsen, because
      he is always cross and stupid and you are good-tempered. And I thought you
      handsome. Well, I did not know my mind. I will not marry you&mdash;the
      thought is ridiculous. You are thirty years old, and I do not like
      Frenchmen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her protestations, the post-chaise still continues its wild
      career. It is dark at last, and the darkness is deepened by long avenues
      of spectral fir-trees which line the road on either side. A diligence
      passes swiftly by, with murmur of voices and jingling of bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night comes on the girl grows frightened, shrinks away from her
      companion, and sobs bitterly. He tries to comfort her with embraces and
      loving words, but she avoids his touch, and rejects all his consolations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were enough light to show his face, it would reveal an aspect
      almost Mephistophelean in its cat-like expression. His long fingers close
      and unclose nervously; he would like to use force, but he lacks the
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he wins her to comparative quiescence by proving to her that
      return is impossible before the morrow, and by promising that when the
      morrow comes he will, if she still wishes it, see her safely back to
      school. With this poor comfort she is obliged to be content; for the house
      she left at daybreak lies thirty miles behind, and it would be useless to
      turn thither now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the lights of a town gleam before them, and, after rattling
      through some dark suburbs, they draw up before the threshold of an inn&mdash;the
      <i>Lion d&rsquo;Or</i>. It is a large dreary place, with little or no custom. A
      ghostly waiter shows them to a great <i>salle à manger</i>, which is
      totally deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While dinner is preparing, perhaps Madame would like to make her
      toilette?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lays emphasis on the &lsquo;Madame&rsquo;; and then demands, respectfully, how many
      chambers will be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline does not hear, but her companion explains that two chambers will
      be wanted&mdash;one for the young lady, one for himself. The waiter bows
      and withdraws. An elderly chambermaid soon appears, and shows Madeline up
      to a great bedroom, grim and lonely as an empty barn, with one little
      chilly bed in the corner. There are no curtains to the window, and the
      moonlight is creeping in with a ghastly gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Madeline resigns herself to remorse and despair, and sobs as
      if her heart would break. An hour passes thus. Then the chambermaid
      appears with the intimation that Monsieur is waiting dinner, and is
      impatient. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Madeline descends.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are alone in the <i>salle à manger</i>, and the first course is
      served, when there enters a muscular young man in a shooting coat, a shirt
      very loose about the collar, and a loose necktie. &lsquo;Englishman&rsquo; is written
      in every lineament of his brown, sun-tanned countenance. In the manner of
      many of his nation, he scowls at his fellow-guests, and then, without a
      word, falls upon the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dish after dish goes from Madeline untasted. She breaks a little bread,
      that is all, and drinks a little Bordeaux and water. Her face is white as
      death, and all the tremendousness of the situation is full upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Belleisle, for his part, feeds ravenously, and drinks more than
      one bottle of light wine. He is agitated, but preserves his composure. In
      his heart he curses the unwelcome third party present; he burns for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third party proceeds leisurely with his dinner, only addressing the waiter
      in monosyllables. He is a man of thirty, of splendid physique and perfect
      health. He seems to see and hear nothing, but all the time his eyes and
      ears are wide open. He starts when the young lady&mdash;whom he has been
      watching quietly&mdash;speaks in the English tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The chambermaid says there is a train from this place to Rouen. It leaves
      at daybreak, Monsieur Belleisle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will talk of that to-morrow,&rsquo; murmurs the Frenchman, with his mouth
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be too late. I will leave by the first train, and get a cab
      from Rouen to Millefleurs. I will explain all&mdash;they may punish me as
      they please&mdash;I do not care.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Diable</i>, and what will then become of me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I suppose you will lose your situation, but you will
      soon get another.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur sinks his voice and whispers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another <i>wife</i>, mignonne? Ah non! If you abandon me I shall blow out
      my brains;&rsquo; then, still in a low voice, inaudible to the other person in
      the room, he continues, &lsquo;But you are mad, my Madeline, to think of going
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hélas, it is too late; you <i>must</i> marry me now, or do you know what
      they will say? They will say that your character is gone, that you are <i>méchante</i>,
      and then no one will marry you to be put to shame. Yes, it is too late.
      You should have thought of this before to-morrow. You must become Madame
      my wife, or you will not be able to face the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the speaker were an individual of any insight, or the least
      sensitiveness, he would get uncomfortable under the calm unconscious
      wonder of the eyes which regard him. His threat, for his words amount to a
      threat, is completely vain. The girl looks at him quietly, and for some
      minutes makes no reply whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this silence, he pours out a low stream of endearing
      epithets, cursing all the time the third party whose presence compels him
      to sink his voice to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that juncture, however, the third party rises, and walks quietly from
      the room. Monsieur Belleisle jumps up, closes the door, and turns to
      Madeline with extended aims, repeating in a louder voice his volley of
      endearments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not talk nonsense, Monsieur,&rsquo; is the girl&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;I am not an angel;
      I am more like a devil, Mademoiselle Collemache has often said. Do not
      come near me&mdash;I will not be embraced. I tell you I will not marry
      you. Even if I liked you well enough, and I don&rsquo;t, it would be too
      absurd.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absurd!&rsquo; echoed the Frenchman, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I am a great deal too young. It was wicked of you, Monsieur, to
      tempt me&mdash;to come upon me when I was in a passion, and persuade me to
      elope.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I love you&mdash;ah Dieu, how much!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, Monsieur. Let me go back to Madame in peace, and
      implore her forgiveness&mdash;I will do so&mdash;on my knees if she wishes
      it. I deserve whipping&mdash;no punishment is too bad for me&mdash;I am so
      wicked.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline,&rsquo; says the Frenchman, yielding at last to the growing fury
      within him, &lsquo;let us finish this folly. I will not lose you so&mdash;no, a
      hundred times no. I tell you there is no escape&mdash;you will marry me
      to-morrow; you will, you must. If you do not, if you refuse, take care.&rsquo;
      And his eyes roll with a look of significance, which she does not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care of what, Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the world&mdash;of <i>me. Voilà!</i> If you do not marry me, you will
      never marry another man! You do not know me&mdash;I am desperate. I will
      follow you up and down the world&mdash;I will say such things, ah, Dieu,
      what will I not say?&mdash;until at last you go upon your bended knees and
      <i>beg</i> me to make you my wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he speaks his face is livid with fury, and he seems positively
      transformed. The girl looks at him in supreme astonishment and growing
      dislike; then she gives a little forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not lose your temper, Monsieur. One would think you were giving a
      French lesson to one of the little girls.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give you such a lesson,&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;as you will remember. I am
      not a common man, and I will not be so befooled&mdash;no, no! You treat
      all love as nothing&mdash;at my devotion you laugh&mdash;you are cruel,
      but <i>I</i> can be cruel too.&mdash;Ah, now, I do not mean that! I love
      you too well. You promised to marry me, and you will marry me, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce
      pas</i>, my Madeline?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He starts and tries to compose his features, for that moment the obnoxious
      third party re-enters the room, and, taking a chair, proceeds, with an air
      of great carelessness, to read a journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an awkward suspense of some minutes, Belleisle, in his turn, leaves
      the apartment, not without glancing significantly at the stranger, and
      expressively putting his finger to his lips to enjoin silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely has he vanished when the third party rises, looks at Madeline,
      and, walking quietly over to her, says in English&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, but is that gentleman your husband?&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;CAGED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hus abruptly
      interrogated, Madeline goes red as crimson, and trembles violently. Then
      by a mighty effort she recovers herself, conquers the violent trembling of
      her hands, and raises her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeats the question; whereupon Madeline turns her head coldly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement is abrupt enough to send her <i>vis-à-vis</i> straight from
      the room, but, curiously enough, he lingers. Madeline does not look at
      him, but she feels that he is examining her&mdash;his eyes search her
      face, her figure, her hands. With an impulsive movement she turns
      slightly, interlaces her fingers, so as to hide from his searching gaze
      the third finger of her left hand; then gives one quick glance at his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know you, monsieur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, <i>Madame</i>.&rsquo; He lays unusual stress upon the title. &lsquo;But the fact
      of your having used the English language must pass as my excuse for having
      addressed you at all. Can I be of any service to you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He asks the question slowly, but without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Madeline
      replies&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer, which is more like a pitiful appeal than a cold dismissal,
      holds the man to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have arranged to leave here by the night train,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;but if I can
      be of the very slightest assistance to you, pray do not hesitate to say
      so. If you wish it, I will remain at hand!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Madeline&rsquo;s cheeks burn with a humiliating sense of shame. Perhaps
      that is the reason she carries her head so haughtily and infuses such a
      harshness into the tone of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no need for you to stay; you cannot be of any use to me; but I
      thank you for the offer, sir. Goodnight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a bow she brings the interview to a decided close, and walks to
      the other end of the room. For a moment or two the Englishman lingers.
      Although he stands at a distance, and with his face turned another way,
      Madeline can feel that he is watching her. At last, with a cold
      &lsquo;Good-night, Madame,&rsquo; he leaves the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has turned to answer his &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; and now her eyes are fixed upon
      the door. The flush upon her cheek burns more brightly than ever, and her
      hands have begun to tremble again; she bites her quivering lip and walks
      impetuously up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I treated him shockingly,&rsquo; she says to herself, &lsquo;but what else could I
      do? Humiliate myself before him&mdash;confess that I had run away from
      school, and that now, like a naughty child, I wanted to be punished and
      then forgiven? If he had been an old man I might have done so. If he had
      been the least homely and comfortable-looking I might have done so&mdash;but
      he was so handsome and so proud-looking&mdash;and so young.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she adds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      41 wonder what M&rsquo;sieur Belleisle is doing? Perhaps I had better ring for
      the waiter, and make arrangements for leaving by the morning train.5
    </p>
    <p>
      She crosses the room, lays her hand upon the bell, is about to ring, when
      Monsieur Belleisle, who has noiselessly entered the room, quietly takes
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first touch of his cold fingers Madeline&rsquo;s face again flushes
      crimson, and she draws her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline cannot see his face&mdash;his head is hung too much forward, but
      his body bends in all humility before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Madeline is cruel,&rsquo; he says in a strangely insinuating tone, &lsquo;but I
      confess to myself that she is right. I confess I have been to blame, but I
      am an honourable man, and I will make all amends.5
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By marrying me, I suppose you mean, M&rsquo;sieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is what I would wish to do, but since it is not <i>your</i> wish, I
      will talk about it no more. I will do what you desire, Mam&rsquo;selle!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what I wish. It is to return to Madame Collemache!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman shrugs his shoulders and spreads out both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;but you know, Mam&rsquo;selle, you cannot leave till
      daybreak, for you have troubled yourself to enquire. Well, in order to
      screen yourself from <i>scandal</i>&rsquo;&mdash;he lays peculiar stress on the
      word&mdash;&lsquo;I will introduce you to a lady who I know will be
      philanthropist enough to give you the shelter of her presence to-night,
      and take you back to Madame Collemache on the morrow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner is obsequious&mdash;far too obsequious to be genuine&mdash;but
      this Madeline does not observe. She only feels a soft sense of relief
      steal over her, and in her gratitude she impulsively takes the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too good, M&rsquo;sieur,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and I shall never rest until I
      have repaid you. I will intercede with Madame Collemache&mdash;I will
      write to Mr. White, my guardian&mdash;I will get you your reward!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman bows still lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Madeline will not trouble herself so much on my account,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I
      have won a leetle of Madeline&rsquo;s esteem&mdash;and so I have my reward. And
      now I have a leetle favour to ask for in return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline&rsquo;s face falls, and though he does not appear to be looking at her
      he notices it in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not be afraid,&rsquo; he continues, reassuringly, but keeping at a
      respectful distance from her. &lsquo;My request is for your good. It is this&mdash;that
      you promise me to remain quietly here for an hour or two; say nothing to
      any one, and not to make arrangements about the journey to-morrow: all
      that shall be done for you. At the end of two hours, say, I will return. I
      will bring with me the respectable lady I have mentioned&mdash;and then,
      with my Madeline&rsquo;s permission, I will make my adieux.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make your adieux?&mdash;ah, M&rsquo;sieur, I am so sorry for you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not talk of me! I shall find another appointment. You will give the
      promise which I ask of you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He takes her hand, bends over it, and kisses it&mdash;and leaves the girl
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time Madeline stands quite still, stupefied by the very intensity of
      her relief. She rests her elbow on the mantelpiece, drops her cheeks upon
      her hands, and fixes her eyes upon the windows, as if to watch the slowly
      gathering gloom. She feels no self-pity; on the events which will probably
      transpire on the morrow her imagination refuses to dwell; she can think
      only of M&rsquo;sieur Belleisle&mdash;of his goodness, his self-sacrifice, his
      devotion. During the whole time of their acquaintance Madeline has never
      thought so highly of her tutor as she does at this moment&mdash;when she
      is preparing, as she thinks, to plunge him into ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her meditations having reached this point are interrupted. The door of the
      <i>salle à manger</i> opens, and the Englishman re-enters the room. He is
      dressed for travelling; he looks around as if searching for something,
      then he paused before the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am just on the point of starting.&rsquo; he says abruptly; and Madeline,
      after puzzling her brain for a suitable reply, says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a fine night for travelling&mdash;I wish you a pleasant journey,
      M&rsquo;sieur.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pauses, and for a moment there is blank silence; then he returned to
      the old question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are sure,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;quite sure, that I can do nothing for you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Madeline, feeling that since her last interview with Monsieur
      Belleisle her mantle of shame has fallen from her, gives such a decided
      negative that her companion goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      How dark it is growing! and, with the coming on of night, how the girl&rsquo;s
      spirits sink! She lights the gas, and looks at her watch. Half an hour
      only has passed since Monsieur Belleisle left her; some time, must yet
      elapse before he returns. Meanwhile, what can she do to make the time hang
      less heavily on her hands? She resolves to write letters, and, having got
      the waiter to supply her with pens, ink, and paper, sits down to concoct
      an epistle to Mr. White.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline is impulsive, and the impulse of gratitude is just now strongly
      upon her. Her letter to White, after giving a short account of her
      elopement, is filled with the most pronounced eulogiums upon Monsieur
      Belleisle&mdash;his goodness, his self-sacrifice&mdash;and ends by asking
      White if he cannot make some reparation to the man. Her letter to Madame
      Collemache is less gushing, but more to the point. In it she promises to
      return on the morrow, implores Madame&rsquo;s forgiveness, and tells her all.
      Having written the letters she hands them to the waiter to be posted
      forthwith. Her letter to Madame Collemache will arrive in the morning, a
      few hours before the return of the unlucky criminal herself. The thought
      of this comforts the girl; it will pave the way for the coming interview,
      and make it less trying, she thinks. When it occurs to her for a moment
      that Madame Collemache may refuse to have any interview at all, she
      reflects that the lady whom Monsieur Belleisle, with an amount of delicate
      consideration she had certainly never given him credit for, has
      volunteered to introduce, will be a sufficient guarantee of her conduct,
      and make all right again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Madeline&rsquo;s meditations are interrupted; this time by a carriage,
      which, after dashing rapidly along the street, stops suddenly before the
      door of the inn. Madeline runs to the window, and is just in time to see,
      by the flickering light of the street lamps, a figure, quietly dressed in
      black, descending from the <i>voiture</i> and entering the door of the
      inn. The arrival seems to have caused a sensation; sounds of voices come
      from below; steps come steadily up the stairs; then the door of the <i>salle
      à manger</i> opens, and the new arrivals enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      One is Monsieur Belleisle, the other a lady clad in heavy widow&rsquo;s
      mourning, who leans rather heavily on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first glance the lady appears to be young&mdash;her step is
      elastic, her figure slight; but when she comes right into the room, and
      stands beneath the glare of the gaslight, one can see at a glance that her
      age must be nearly sixty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair, which is brushed very smooth beneath her widow&rsquo;s bonnet, is
      white as snow, and her whole face bears the unmistakable stamp of care.
      Madeline is glad; the widow&rsquo;s mourning, the white hair and wrinkled face,
      seem to shed all over her the halo of respectability. With a childish
      faith in the sex of the new-comer, she steps forward impulsively, holding
      out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur introduces the lady as his &lsquo;very good friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay;&rsquo; then after a word or two, he takes a respectful
      farewell of Madeline and goes. He will not even remain in the same hotel
      which holds the girl that night, so careful is he of her good name&mdash;but
      five minutes after he has left the <i>salle à manger</i>, Madeline, who is
      looking from the window, sees him enter the post-chaise lately occupied by
      Madame de Fontenay, and drive rapidly from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline, stricken with remorse, has asked his plans, but he has told her
      nothing. When she hinted that she might wish to communicate with him, he
      replied that any communication for him can be sent through Madame de
      Fontenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, while the carriage which contains Monsieur Belleisle is rolling
      away through the thickening darkness, Madeline turns to discuss her tutor
      with her new friend. She has waxed eloquent in her praise of him, and is
      just in the middle of a fresh eulogium, when the waiter brings in the
      supper, and Madame de Fontenay retires to prepare for the meal. When she
      returns, divested of her bonnet and her cloak, and takes her seat at the
      head of the table, she says&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I ordered supper, ma chère Mam&rsquo;selle Hazlemere,
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the liberty of ordering it for two, for look you, ever since the
      days of my childhood I could never bear to eat alone. You will join me?
      Non? Well, you will at least break a biscuit and drink with me a glass of
      wine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Madeline, who has turned from the supper, takes her seat at the
      table to crumble her biscuit and sip the wine which Madame de Fontenay has
      poured; but at this juncture Madeline grows thoughtful, and Madame de
      Fontenay, who has hitherto been rather reticent, grows very talkative
      indeed, sips her wine with a relish, disposes of the various courses,
      pausing now and again to glance with piercing eyes at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper being over, Madame rises and slips her hand through Madeline&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to the window, Mademoiselle,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and take a breath of air
      while the waiter prepares the coffee. But first&mdash;see, you have not
      finished your wine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifts the glass, which still holds a little wine, and offers it to
      Madeline, but the girl, with a deprecating movement, turns away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot take any more of that wine, Madame,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;it is very
      strong; I think it has made me feel quite stupid.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay gives a little laugh, and holding her hand still
      tighter on her companion&rsquo;s arm, and leading her to a seat in the window,
      places herself by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my child,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;it is not the effect of the wine; it is the
      result of the trouble, the excitement, the fatigue, through which you have
      passed this day. You will get to bed, and rise in the morning refreshed
      for your journey back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline assents. She sits in the window allowing the widow to stroke her
      feverishly burning hand; but as that strange drowsiness oppresses her more
      and more, she goes to bed and falls into a heavy slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awakens it is broad day; a figure dressed in black is bending
      above her, holding a tray. Madeline rubs her eyes&mdash;then, looking
      through a mist which seems to obscure her sight, she recognises the pale,
      bloodless features of Madame de Fontenay; she looks round the room,
      everything is misted; she rises in bed, and finds she can scarcely sit up.
      Her temples throb, her head burns&mdash;she seems to have been seized with
      fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in one flash the reality of her situation comes upon her, and she
      gazes at the window with wild frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The morning train to Rouen is gone?&rsquo; she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay bends above her with a kind, reassuring smile. She has
      placed the tray on a table which she has drawn up beside the bed; and now
      she presses her cold white hands to Madeline&rsquo;s throbbing brow. As she does
      so a strange light comes into her eyes, a curious smile contracts her
      mouth; but her voice is quite melodious when she speaks again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The morning train is gone&mdash;yes, that is so,&rsquo; she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came and looked at you half an hour before the train started, and I did
      not wake you, since I saw you were not fit to travel. You are sickening
      for an illness, and I must remove you carefully. I have ordered a carriage
      to be at the door in half an hour. You will take this breakfast which I
      have brought to you, and dress yourself&mdash;<i>après</i>, we will start
      for Rouen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline assents; half an hour later she is seated in a close carriage,
      resting her throbbing head on Madame de Fontenay&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How your brow burns, my dear child,&rsquo; says Madame de Fontenay, drawing off
      one of her gloves, and laying her cool fingers on the throbbing temples of
      the girl; then she produces a small gold-mounted vinaigrette and offers it
      to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Smell this occasionally, and it will relieve the feverish condition&mdash;above
      all, remain tranquil, and close your eyes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of this advice is quite unnecessary; although Madeline&rsquo;s
      head is burning more feverishly than ever, although her temples continue
      to throb, her lips feel parched and dry&mdash;she feels gradually stealing
      over her a strange sense of languor, which compels her to shut her eyes
      and lean more heavily upon her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage, which is drawn by two horses, proceeds quickly on its way.
      Madame de Fontenay thrusts her head and shoulders out of the carriage
      window to give some directions to the coachman. What she says Madeline
      does not know. She can only hear a confused murmur of voices, which seem
      to come to her through the vapours of a dream. She hears the murmurs, she
      feels the lady reseat herself, then she knows that the carriage is going
      even faster than before; and she again relapses into a dim state of
      stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next she opens her eyes the carriage has stopped, and Madame de
      Fontenay, with some assistance, is helping her to alight. When she stands
      erect in the open air her head begins to swim; she reels, and is caught in
      somebody&rsquo;s arms. She gazes vacantly about her, and as she does so she
      grows still more confused. She is at a railway station, and although her
      senses are very much dulled she possesses reason enough to know she has
      never been there before. She is about to speak, when Madame de Fontenay,
      putting an arm affectionately around her, half leads, half pushes her
      forward; then she is hurriedly thrust into a first-class carriage, the
      doors are banged to, and the train moves off. As it does so, she makes a
      strong effort to shake off the dreamy stupor which seems to be paralysing
      her whole body&mdash;she looks around the carriage. Besides herself, the
      only other occupant of the compartment is Madame de Fontenay, who, bending
      over a small wicker basket, is busily engaged in producing eatables and a
      little wine. There is a light burning in the carriage roof, and when
      Madeline looks out of the carriage window she is amazed to find that day
      is fast fading into night.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange country they are passing through! She racks her brain,
      trying to remember if she has ever seen it before; but the more she tries
      to collect her thoughts, the more confused and clouded they become.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light touch from her companion rouses her from her reverie; she looks
      round; Madame de Fontenay is offering her a sandwich&mdash;she takes it;
      she is growing sick and faint for want of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; asks Madeline; but it is evident that Madame de Fontenay
      does not hear. She sits composedly in one corner, eats some sandwiches,
      and sips some wine. Presently she rises, turns her back upon her companion
      for a moment, then approaching her, offers her a little wine. Madeline
      turns aside her head, and holds up her hands as if to push the glass away.
      She has grown to detest the wine, for whenever she sips it she seems to
      feel that strange drowsiness increase; but Madame de Fontenay, who is not
      quite so yielding as she has been heretofore, takes the girl&rsquo;s nerveless
      hands in her own, and, holding the glass to her bloodless lips, forces her
      to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train speeds on, the hours go by wearily and slowly, and with the
      passing of every hour the darkness deepens. Madeline, feeling utterly
      prostrated and paralysed, sits helpless in her corner of the carriage, and
      Madame de Fontenay sleeps. Her sleep is evidently of the lightest, for
      whenever the train stops she starts to her feet, rushes to the door and
      keeps her stand there, while sounds of feet rise and die upon the
      platform, and the train moves on again. Madeline tries to rise, but her
      strength fails her; she tries to speak&mdash;the words die upon her lips
      in a faint inarticulate sound&mdash;something catches her breath and
      parches her tongue. Thus the night passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn breaks, and almost with the first streak of daybreak the train comes
      to a stand again, and Madeline is assisted out. Again she tries to speak,
      but her low faint murmurs are lost amidst the bustle, the confusion, the
      loud cries of the railway officials. She is hurried through the crowd into
      a carriage, and before she can collect her wandering senses to protest she
      is again being whirled rapidly onward. A drive of some minutes; then the
      carriage passes through a narrow street and stops before a door. Madeline
      is taken from the carriage, conducted up a flight of stone steps into a
      finely furnished room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man is standing before her. At the sight of his face her dulled senses
      seem suddenly to brighten. She utters two words, his name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur Belleisle!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman bows, smiles, and extends both his hands toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;welcome, <i>mon ange!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry Madeline shrinks back, her soul sickens, her dim wandering eyes
      begin to dilate with fear. She presses both her hands to her throbbing
      temples, and stares at the Frenchman again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are <i>you</i> here, M&rsquo;sieur?&rsquo; she says hurriedly; &lsquo;what has been
      done to me&mdash;where am I?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman bows again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have brought you to me, <i>mon ange,</i> he says. &lsquo;You are in the
      house of my very good friend, Madame de Fontenay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something in his face which causes Madeline to shrink back with
      horror; then, with, a low cry, she covers her face with her hands and
      falls in a swoon upon the floor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;MADELINE AWAKES FROM HER DREAM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat very day,
      either with or without her consent, Madeline Hazlemere was made Madeline
      Belleisle; at least, a certain form of marriage was gone through, in the
      presence of Madame de Fontenay and several strangers, and before a person
      in the habit of a priest. Madeline had now no power to resist, for the
      influence of some strange opiate was upon her&mdash;dulling all her
      senses, and making the first few days of her married life pass in a sort
      of dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      They travelled for a couple of days; then paused, and lived for a week or
      so in some quaint little village by the sea. Where it was Madeline did not
      know; she had not even energy enough to inquire; unresisting,
      uncomplaining, she was led about like a lamb going to the slaughter. In
      the morning she walked along the sands by the Frenchman&rsquo;s side, and
      dreamily watched the fashionable Parisian bathers disporting themselves in
      the waves; then she returned home to spend the rest of the day with Madame
      de Fontenay (who, for some mysterious reason, had never once left the
      married pair), while Monsieur Belleisle betook himself to the café to
      spend his evenings in his own favourite way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be expected that the days would continue to glide thus
      smoothly along; nevertheless the peace was broken rather sooner than one
      would have anticipated. One morning, as Madeline rose from the breakfast
      table and put on her hat for a stroll along the sands, her husband laid
      his hand upon her arm and drew her into her seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, <i>mon amie!</i> he said in his blandest tone, &lsquo;I wish to
      arrange with you concerning our domestic life. I should have wished the
      first advance to come from you; but since that cannot be, since you take
      so little interest in our <i>menage</i> as to be indifferent to it, it is
      time for me to speak.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sat quietly where she had been placed, and fixed her eyes sadly
      upon the Frenchman. He had used her like a villain, but for the moment the
      part which he had played was partially or entirely forgotten. She thought
      only of the man who had first awakened romance within her. Had Monsieur
      Belleisle spoken kindly, had he infused into his tone and words one-half
      the tenderness which at one time he had at his command, she might have
      thrown herself into his arms, with tears of tenderness and sorrow; but his
      manner chilled her, and her rising tears were checked by the presence of
      Madame de Fontenay, who sat in the room quietly watching and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline remained silent; so the Frenchman spoke again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you suppose,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that we are to live, my dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Madeline was dumb&mdash;what could he mean by asking her such a
      question?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will write,&rsquo; continued Monsieur Belleisle&mdash;&lsquo;write at once, for
      enough time has been wasted, to your English guardian&mdash;M&rsquo;sieur White,
      I think you have called him&mdash;and ask him to send you two hundred
      pounds.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Madeline stared in silence. She was not thinking of the Frenchman
      now. All her present surroundings faded away, and she saw only the
      pleasant little studio in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, with the dearly beloved figure
      of White standing amidst his brushes, canvas, and paints. But he was not
      looking genially about him, as she had so often seen him do; his eyes were
      fixed with a look of sad reproach upon the painted face of a gipsy-like
      girl of ten, and his voice cried out with a ring of terrible sorrow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline&mdash;my little Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl saw and heard, and in her anguish she dropped her face in her
      hands and burst into a passionate flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the first tears she had shed since her marriage. The storm had
      been long in bursting; but now its violence was intense. For a time she
      remained utterly prostrated by her sorrow; when she raised her head she
      saw that the Frenchman was calmly looking on..
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it over?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not answer him; she stifled her sobs, dried her eyes, and
      walked over to the window. The Frenchman followed her with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are longing for your morning walk, my wife,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;<i>eh bien</i>,
      write the letter and you shall go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot write the letter, M&rsquo;sieur Belleisle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then give me the address of M&rsquo;sieur White, and I will do so for you, <i>mon
      amie</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your only object in writing is to get money,&rsquo; remarked Madeline
      quietly, &lsquo;you may save yourself the trouble, M&rsquo;sieur&mdash;I do not think
      Mr. White has two hundred pounds in the whole world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I say, M&rsquo;sieur.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That M&rsquo;sieur White is a poor man?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very, very poor&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet he sent you to the pension of Madame Collemache, and you spread
      the report in Millefleurs that your English guardian was a great artist
      and a rich man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I did not spread any such report. Mr. White pinched himself to
      pay for my schooling, and I have repaid him by&mdash;by&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, for Belleisle suddenly interposed with an exclamation so
      brutal, so coarse and savage, that she stared at him in a new terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outburst over, he sank into a chair, looking positively livid. What
      could Madeline say or do? She did not know. She stood staring stupidly at
      the Frenchman until he spoke again. He rose and came towards her, hissing
      his words through his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If M&rsquo;sieur White has no money, if you have no money, why then did you run
      away from your school and marry <i>me?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ran away from school because I was a foolish, ungrateful, headstrong
      girl, M&rsquo;sieur, and I married you because you used cowardly, cruel means
      and forced me to do so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman laughed, stretching his long thin mouth from ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I force you to marry me, and make you a martyr, I suppose?&mdash;that is
      very good. But hear the truth from me, Madame&mdash;and unless you are
      careful, all the world shall know it too. I marry you simply out of pity.
      I am seduced by you to carry you off from school, and then, out of pity
      for you, I marry you and save you; yes, I sacrifice myself by taking a
      wife whose fame is gone&mdash;and then, when I look for a little help from
      you, you say &ldquo;I give you none&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ended with an expletive which made the girl&rsquo;s cheek burn with shame,
      and brought her trembling to her feet, with wrathful flame in her great
      blue eyes. For a moment he shrank before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not try grand airs with <i>me</i>. Madame&mdash;you had better think
      how you are to live!&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and, with another oath, he hurriedly
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Madame Fontenay had kept her seat; but though her body had
      been inactive, her tongue silent, her eyes had done enough for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of the preceding interview they had been fixed with calm,
      cold scrutiny on Madeline&rsquo;s face. She had noted every flush on her cheek,
      every curve of the lip, every look that was shot from the tearful eyes;
      finally, her cold grey orbs were fixed more steadily than ever upon the
      girl as she stood watching the door which had just been closed upon the
      enraged husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mon Dieu!&rsquo; mentally exclaimed Madame de Fontenay, &lsquo;the girl is superb, is
      magnificent&mdash;a face like that should be fortune enough for any man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her seat and went over to Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor child,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;this is your first quarrel, let us hope it
      will be your last. Emile Belleisle is a fool and a brute this morning&mdash;but
      he is not always so. Do not grieve, <i>ma chère</i>, or your good looks
      will leave you. I will reprove him for his insolence, and he&mdash;well,
      he shall make amends!&rsquo; and she followed her accomplice, leaving Madeline
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the girl stood, moveless, speechless, comprehending only in a
      dull, stupefied manner the reality of all that had passed. Her eyes were
      tearless, her lips firmly set together, but her hands were trembling and
      cold as death. She seemed to see the Frenchman&rsquo;s face before her, she
      seemed to hear his words; then again there came to her the pitiful refrain
      from the man whose heart she feared to have broken&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline&mdash;my little Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she sank down, crying&mdash;ah, what a relief she found in those
      tears! When they subsided her brain began to work, and she wondered what
      she must do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that moment she had sometimes pitied Monsieur Belleisle, if she
      could not love him. But that was all over; he had slain her pity, and he
      had not awakened affection. She knew now why the man wooed her, carried
      her off from school, and by force married her&mdash;he fancied her a rich
      heiress, a girl who would enable him to renounce his slavery of teaching
      and live in luxury all his days. Had this indeed been the case, Belleisle
      would have made a tolerably quiet husband; the sudden darkening of his
      daydreams had turned him into a devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Madeline thought &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; but the answer would not shape
      itself. The idea of writing to White repelled her, for she remembered the
      letter which she had sent to him little more than three weeks before&mdash;a
      letter overflowing with eulogiums upon Monsieur Belleisle. She could not
      write yet&mdash;rather let White think her dead than alive to cause him
      further sorrow. She had made her own bed; come what may, she would lie on
      it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she sat, half crying, listening in a vague dreamy way to the traffic in
      the village street, when the room door suddenly opened, and Monsieur
      Belleisle returned. At his entrance she raised her head; at the sight of
      her tormentor she dropped it again, and coldly turned away. He did not
      approach her&mdash;he walked about the room for some minutes; then he sat,
      and there was silence. How still the room was! Madeline could hear the
      beating of her heart; her breath came fast and thick: her hands were
      growing clammily cold; anger, self-pity, resentment, were struggling in
      her breast, but her quivering lips would not open.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round the room. There sat the Frenchman in his easy-chair, with
      his eyes fixed gloomily upon the empty hearth. She rose to leave the room;
      in a moment the man sprang forward and stood in humiliation before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, my wife&mdash;will you forgive me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him in blank amazement. She could not answer him, and
      he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a passionate man&mdash;I have an uncontrollable temper, but I am not
      slow to say I am wrong&mdash;forgive me, my Madeline, I have wronged you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stretched forth both his hands, but she instinctively
      shrank away. It was well that she could not see the expression of his face
      as she did so. He bowed before her, and spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Eh bien!</i>&rsquo; he said softly&mdash;so softly, so meltingly, she could
      hardly bring herself to believe it to be the same man who had insulted her
      a little before. &lsquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, I deserve that you should shrink from
      me, but now I will make amends for my brutal conduct, and you shall try to
      forget, <i>chérie</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If Madeline had been herself she might have remembered that it was in this
      very guise of humility that Monsieur Belleisle came to her when he had
      determined upon doing her the greatest wrong which she had ever received
      in her life; but she was a mere child, and did not remember; the agonising
      hours spent in the hotel at Fécamp were for the moment forgotten, and the
      Frenchman spoke on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes, his offence had been great; but he determined to make full
      reparation. He admitted that he was sorry to find that he had wed a
      penniless wife, but his sorrow was gone, his anger overcome; he declared
      now that his wife possessed attributes which money could not buy, and the
      want of money, save that it might deprive <i>her</i> of certain luxuries,
      troubled him not at all. This, then, was his purposed reparation, that
      Madeline should go to her room and spend the day in resting; that,
      subsequently, she should array herself in evening costume and accompany
      her Emile to a pleasant dinner, and go to a place of entertainment
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Madeline looked at the man in stupefied amazement. Whether or not he
      was straightforward and honest she could not tell, nor did she pause to
      inquire; she gave a trembling consent to all his wishes, and passed alone
      up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      How quiet it was there! What a blessed relief from the presence of her
      tormentor. She poured some eau de Cologne on her forehead, threw herself
      on the cool white bed, and closed her aching eyes. How long she lay thus
      she did not know; the next thing she was conscious of was a knock at the
      door&mdash;then a maid entered, hearing some biscuits and a glass of wine.
      She informed Madeline that Monsieur had sent this refreshment to Madame,
      as he feared that the long day&rsquo;s fast would make her faint for the
      evening; she bore also, from Monsieur, a small three-cornered note, which
      Madeline laid aside until the girl had quitted the room, when she
      proceeded to acquaint herself with the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My own little wife&mdash;my beautiful Madeline [thus wrote Monsieur
      Belleisle, in his own language], if you wish to please me&mdash;although I
      am not worthy your forbearance&mdash;still, sweet one, if you can forgive
      me, and will try to please me, you will make yourself look tonight
      divinely fair. There are many fair faces in this place&mdash;many will
      meet us to-night, but I wish my wife to be without a rival in the
      loveliness which is hers! Your own</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Emile.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline read the letter twice, crumpled it in her hand, and threw it
      aside. She drank the wine which had been sent to her, and ate a biscuit;
      then, feeling somewhat refreshed and a good deal clearer in the head, she
      reviewed in her mind the exact state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first impulse that morning had been to leave her husband, to travel
      back to England and throw herself on the compassion of Mr. White. She knew
      that he would forgive her, kiss her, cry over her, and, looking a little
      saddened perhaps, take her to his hearth, as he had once done before. But
      now her common sense told her that a <i>husband</i> could not be disposed
      of so readily. It was quite evident to her that Monsieur Belleisle,
      despite his violent words in the morning, did not wish to resign the bride
      he had taken so much trouble to win. If she were to return to her home, he
      might seek her out, and force her to return to him&mdash;or if she hid
      herself, he would be quite capable in his anger of making public such a
      story as would shame her for ever. The affair would be raked up for public
      comment, and the woman would be martyred, the man made a hero&mdash;as
      usual. Mrs. Grundy would hold up her hands in horror at the idea of a
      girl, still in her teens, forcing her music master to run away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the case would always stand so, for Madeline could not even urge in
      palliation of her act of desertion the fact of cruelty. Belleisle had
      spoken harshly, to be sure, but then how many husbands often did the same,
      and how few of them had the good taste to make so humiliating an apology?
      Perhaps after all he loved her in his own peculiar fashion, and if he was
      willing to atone, why the best thing she could do was to meet him half
      way, and, if she could not be happy, to try at least and be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her watch; five o&rsquo;clock. How quickly, and yet how wearily,
      the day had gone by! How white, how haggard, and old she looked! And he
      wanted her to eclipse the Parisian ladies who had come down to revive
      their beauty by the sea. She did not know that she had already done so,
      that during her daily walks on the seashore she had several times been
      pointed out as &lsquo;the beautiful Mademoiselle Anglaise,&rsquo; whose sad eyes had
      unconsciously touched many hearts, and whose story many were guessing at,
      but no one knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she shook off her apathy, and tried to forget her sorrow. If she
      must appear in public she would not disgrace herself or her nation. She
      gave no thought to Monsieur Belleisle, but she rubbed her pale cheeks
      until the roses came, and then threw open the doors of her wardrobe to
      select a dress for that evening&rsquo;s wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Select a dress!&rsquo; How farcial it seemed! Belleisle had spoken truly when
      he said that he had wed a beggar. The only dress which was at all fit for
      her to wear was one which had been presented to her by himself some two
      days after their marriage&mdash;a dress of black silk, very youthful in
      cut, displaying very freely her throat, neck, shoulders, and arms, and
      fastening in at the waist with an amber girdle&mdash;a dress Greek in
      design, French in the arrangement of colours, and looking most bewitching
      when draped about the figure of the sad-eyed English girl; whose arms were
      so round and white, whose shoulders so graceful and be fair, and whose
      whole appearance was pretty enough to subdue the most inveterate
      woman-hater in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrayed in her simple dress the child stood before the mirror well pleased
      with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like dear, kind, good Mr. White to see me now,&rsquo; she said to
      herself. &lsquo;I should like just now to run into the dear old studio in St.
      John&rsquo;s Wood, without letting Timothy announce me, as he did once before,
      and throw my arms round my dear old guardian&rsquo;s neck.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, <i>mon amie</i>, forgive me for interrupting you,&rsquo; said Madame
      de Fontenay, advancing slowly into the room; &lsquo;I knocked twice and you did
      not answer me, so I thought you must be sleeping.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline bit her lip, pretended to arrange some stray locks of her hair,
      but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Ma foi</i>,&rsquo; continued the widow, &lsquo;but you look charming; add this
      diamond and your toilette will be complete.&rsquo; As Madeline turned to face
      the widow, she started on seeing that she too wore evening dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay looked more motherly, more thoroughly saddened with
      respectability, than ever she had been before. She wore a dress of heavy
      widow&rsquo;s mourning&mdash;composed of silk, crape, and jet; a widow&rsquo;s cap,
      composed of three pretty folds, crowned her wavy masses of glittering grey
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you go with us to-night, Madame?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emile has done me the honour to ask me, and I have consented. I trust my
      presence will not be unpleasant to you, my child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Madeline did not reply. She disliked Madame de Fontenay, and
      yet she feared her. She knew that the widow had been instrumental in
      marrying her to Monsieur Belleisle, and, not content with that, had kept
      with them, watching as the hawk watches the dove the poor victim whom she
      had caught, and frequently preventing by her very presence, anything like
      a proper understanding between man and wife. And Madeline had a repulsion
      for the woman. She felt that she was the Frenchman&rsquo;s evil genius, ready to
      pander to his passions, and counteract any inclination he might have
      towards nobility and goodness. Still the pale widow&rsquo;s star was in the
      ascendant just then, and Madeline was powerless. She felt it would be
      unwise to make an open enemy of Madame; at any rate until she had won over
      her accomplice. So she parried the question politely, and fixed her eyes
      on the case which Madame held in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diamonds, did you say, for me, Madame? I thought Monsieur Belleisle was
      poor?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he was a week ago, but now he gives you these&mdash;put them on, my
      child&mdash;and hurry down, for Emile is waiting;&rsquo; and without saying more
      she quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline opened the case which the widow had left behind her, and looked
      in surprise at the contents. Three diamond stones for the hair, a ruby
      band for the neck, and a fragile diamond bracelet for the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put them on, and, throwing a thin lace scarf over her shoulders, ran
      down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Monsieur Belleisle waiting for her, clad also in becoming
      evening dress, and looking handsomer than she had ever seen him look
      before. He glanced at her approvingly from head to foot, kissed her, and
      led her to a carriage, which was waiting at the door, and which already
      held Madame de Fontenay. As soon as they were seated the horses moved off;
      whither, Madeline did not know. A drive of a few minutes brought them to
      the door of a brilliantly lighted building. The horses were pulled up;
      Monsieur Belleisle alighted, handed out Madame de Fontenay, then tenderly
      lifted Madeline in his arms and put her on the ground. He placed her hand
      upon his arm and led her forward&mdash;through a great lobby, and finally
      into a room where some two hundred people were seated at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the three last guests attracted a good deal of attention.
      Madeline, still holding her husbands arm, and led by him down one side of
      the long room and up the other, began to blush and cast down her eyes in
      confusion, for she felt herself rapidly becoming the centre of
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length places were found, and they commenced dinner. Again Madeline was
      confused and abashed, not by the public gaze this time, but by the
      assiduous attentions of her husband and Madame de Fontenay. They treated
      her if she were some princess, who condescended when she smiled upon them
      and did them honour when she spoke. The girl was more troubled than ever,
      but she no longer tried to solve the strange problem. She received the
      homage of her husband with becoming gentleness, and ate her dinner as
      contentedly as she could under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, Monsieur Belleisle rose, offered Madeline his arm, and, with
      much bustle and turmoil, conducted her from the room&mdash;the pallid
      widow following. Again she felt herself the centre of attraction, and,
      feeling less abashed, she held up her head with becoming grace and
      confidence, and swept her bright eyes along the ranks of flushed, admiring
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Madeline,&rsquo; said Monsieur Belleisle to her that night, &lsquo;it is not
      always a rich wife who brings happiness to a man. I married a treasure
      when I married <i>you, chérie</i>.&rsquo; To the widow he said, when the two
      were closeted alone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What say you to our plan now, Madame?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I said before. The girl has beauty enough to send Paris mad, if she
      remains in the hands of a careful master.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;DARKER DAYS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat one exciting
      evening over, Madeline&rsquo;s life in the place became even more monotonous
      than it had been before. Every morning she was taken out, either by
      Monsieur Belleisle or Madame de Fontenay; but her walks were made in
      sequestered places, not amongst the gay throng of tourists who daily
      dipped themselves into the sea. Her evenings were spent quietly at home.
      But she was always met with the promise that the dulness of her present
      life was transitory, that there were brighter days in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      That some mysterious work was going on Madeline knew from the strange
      behaviour of her husband and the widow. Sometimes he himself would
      disappear for several days together, leaving his wife in the care of
      Madame; then the lady would disappear, and for several days Madeline would
      be left alone with her husband; then, just as she was congratulating
      herself upon the relief, the widow would return&mdash;looking more benign
      than ever&mdash;and adding to Madeline&rsquo;s wonder by endless secret
      interviews with Belleisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the girl&rsquo;s mind been occupied with this pair alone she would certainly
      have thought their conduct more suspicious still, but she had other things
      to interest and trouble her. Since that night when, dressed in diamonds
      and lace, she had been taken to dine in public, she had written to her
      guardian three times, and had waited eagerly for the reply, which, she now
      began to fear, would never come. The only explanation she could give of
      the affair was that Mr. White, on hearing of her elopement, had gone over
      to the school to look into the matter, and that the investigation and
      journey had kept him a long time from home, so that the letters written
      from time to time by his penitent ward were lying unopened in his studio
      in St. John&rsquo;s Wood. Madeline had arrived at this impotent conclusion, and
      was deriving some sad consolation from it, when her little spell of peace
      was brought to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated in the sitting-room one night, silently working at some
      embroidery; Belleisle reclining in an easy-chair oy the window, scanning
      the columns of &lsquo;Le Journal pour Rire,&rsquo; when the postman arrived and
      letters were brought in&mdash;two for Belleisle and one for his wife. The
      Frenchman took his, read them, returned them to their envelopes, threw
      them carelessly on to a little table at his side, and again concentrated
      his attention on the more amusing contents of the paper, or rather he
      tried to do so, for by this time it did not seem so easy for him to
      concentrate his thoughts at all. His eyes, which had hitherto travelled
      from line to line, now wandered from column to column&mdash;then his hands
      fell slightly, lowering the paper, and his eyes looked over the top at
      Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not moved from her seat; her work lay in her lap; and her hands,
      now trembling violently, held the open letter, upon which her eyes were
      fixed. Belleisle threw the paper aside, and walked towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned her white face towards him, gave him the letter, then
      burst into a violent flood of tears. He took the letter, and read as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Madame Belleisle,&mdash;When you eloped from school with your beggarly
      French tutor you brought disgrace upon yourself and me. Remain with your
      husband&mdash;be true to him, if you can&mdash;as for me, I never wish
      either to see or hear of you again.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>M. White.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Belleisle read the letter than he tore it into fragments and
      threw them into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man is a villain and a coward,&rsquo; he exclaimed; then, as Madeline rose
      to protest, he threw his arms around her and kissed her tear-stained
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive me, <i>chérie</i>,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the man may say what he likes of
      me, but I cannot bear that he shall insult my wife. Listen, Madeline,&rsquo; he
      continued, drawing her down upon a seat beside him, &lsquo;I will correct your
      bad news with good news, though I did not intend to tell you so soon;
      well, my wife, after all you did not marry a poor man. I have had a good
      sum of money left to me and a fine house in Paris&mdash;and I am going to
      dress you in a fashion becoming to a rich man&rsquo;s wife, and take you to
      Paris for the season. You understand me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the girl was looking at him as if she comprehended nothing, and now
      she only said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave me a few minutes alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her and led her to the door, as if his only wish in life was to
      bow to her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours after, when husband and wife met again, Madeline seemed to be
      transformed into a different being. She walked straight up to her husband,
      put her hand into his, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When are we going to Paris, Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are eager to be gone?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I could not bear to continue this quiet life <i>now</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not yourself this morning, so I did not tell you all my news.
      Are you composed enough to listen to me now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, there is a condition attached to the will which left me all
      the money&mdash;a condition to which I fear you will not be inclined to
      accede, <i>chérie</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline raised her eyes to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have told me the news at a proper time then, Monsieur; I feel
      inclined to accede to anything to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; said the Frenchman gravely, &lsquo;I would not ask you to accede to
      anything wrong. Well, the words in the will are these: &ldquo;Five thousand
      pounds to my dear nephew, Emile Belleisle, if he is unwed. If he remain
      unwed for one year after my decease, the sum of three thousand pounds to
      be paid to him annually during his life. If he marries within the year the
      said three thousand pounds per annum to be paid to the State.&rdquo; Now when my
      beloved relative died I was a single man&mdash;when the news came to me I
      had been married two days. Perhaps it was avaricious of me; but as I was
      so wretchedly poor I could not bear the thought of three thousand pounds
      per annum being taken from me and given to the State; so I thought, &ldquo;I
      will say nothing of being married; I will take my Madeline to the seaside,
      and live quietly with her until the year is expired, and then the money
      will be mine to pour at her feet.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what has induced you to change your mind?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My beloved one, you shall hear. I made a confidante of my good aunt,
      Madame de Fontenay, and, though she loves you not as I do, her woman&rsquo;s
      heart did you more justice. She said, &ldquo;Why should the child suffer because
      you have come into a fortune? She has a good heart and generous impulses.
      Tell her&mdash;throw yourself upon her mercy&mdash;and let her enjoy your
      good fortune to the full.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he paused; and again Madeline looked at him inquiringly. What did it
      all mean? He was evidently afraid to speak on without some encouragement
      from her; and the encouragement was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her curiosity being aroused, she argued within herself it could do her no
      possible harm just to hear what he had to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, M&rsquo;sieur?* she cried, and Belleisle spoke on. His demand was simple
      in itself and easily acceded to. He would take his Madeline to Paris in a
      few days, he said; deck her in silks, satins, and jewels; give her a
      season of genuine Parisian life&mdash;if she would but consent to remove
      that frail band of gold from the third finger of her left hand; call her
      husband &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; Madame de Fontenay &ldquo;Maman,&rdquo; until the prescribed year
      had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline heard him without comment, and remained silent after he had
      ceased to speak. What could she do? Her conscience urged her not to
      accept. The man had deceived her infamously already, and would not scruple
      to do so again; but then she remembered the letter which she had received
      that morning, and the voice within her was hushed. After all, she said to
      herself, what harm could come of it; she was secure against calumny, for
      she was in reality Madame Belleisle&mdash;so that should the worst come,
      and her relationship to the man be discovered, no one could possibly blame
      her. And if she refused, what was the alternative? To live alone by the
      sea during all the long, weary winter months, with such a past to reflect
      on&mdash;and not a soul either to share her sorrows or her moments of
      calmness and peace. The prospect was so dismal that the girl shuddered,
      and, looking into her husband&rsquo;s face, said hurriedly, as if she had
      strange misgivings of herself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I consent, Monsieur, I consent&mdash;only let us get away from this
      place, and perhaps the excitement of the journey will take away this load
      from my heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a week from that day three travellers were journeying towards the gay
      French capital; their names were&mdash;the Vicomte de Belleisle, for the
      Frenchman professed to inherit a title with his fortune; Madame and
      Mademoiselle de Fontenay.

      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;BELLEISLE SPREADS HIS NET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>adeline&mdash;I
      wish you to do me a favour?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that is, Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To wear to-night the satin dress and the pearl ornaments which I gave to
      you three weeks ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belleisle was standing before his wife, buttoning the kid gloves which
      reached almost to her elbow; for she was ready to take her usual morning
      drive with Madame de Fontenay. The girl allowed him to finish his task,
      then she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is it you wish me to wear that dress, Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, <i>chérie</i>, we shall have a new guest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young French nobleman&mdash;whom, if we wish to stand well in society,
      it is our interest to fascinate.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To fascinate!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ejaculation made Belleisle look sharply into his wife&rsquo;s face. He was
      by no means pleased by what he saw there. He opened his lips to speak, but
      was prevented by the entrance of Madame de Fontenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow, dressed as usual in rich widow&rsquo;s mourning, came quickly into
      the room, and took Madeline&rsquo;s gloved hand in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thousand apologies for having kept you waiting,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Come, my
      child&mdash;Emile, be good enough to see us to the carriage, which has
      already waited some minutes at the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Belleisle, obedient to the command, conducted the ladies down the oak
      staircase of the hotel, handed them into the carriage which waited to
      receive them, and stood bare-headed at the door to see it roll away. He
      smiled, waved his hand and kissed the tips of his fingers&mdash;but
      Madeline, to whom these blandishments were cast, had already sunk back
      into the carriage, and relapsed into a gloomy dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a good deal to think about&mdash;much to try and explain to
      herself&mdash;and she had chosen this time as the best for what she had to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been located in Paris for three months now, and during that time
      she had led a life which puzzled even herself. Gentle and confiding,
      guided wholly by her husband and his accomplice, she had carried out their
      wishes in every respect. She had dressed herself in the fine dresses which
      were brought to her&mdash;driven about in a carriage by the side of her <i>soi-disant</i>
      mother, and behaved as she had been taught to the guests whom she met at
      her husband&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the behaviour of these guests which troubled her and first set her
      speculating as to the kind of life into which she had unwittingly been
      led. She was not astonished that they should court her favours, for when
      she announced herself single she laid herself open to the admiration of
      single men&mdash;what astonished her was that after these gentlemen had
      ceased to grace with their presence the hospitable board of the Vicomte de
      Belleisle, they would acknowledge with a stony stare the graceful salute
      of the widow if she happened to meet them during any of her daily drives
      about the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious, Madeline thought, and on the impulse of the moment she
      mentioned the fact to her husband and Madame. They looked significantly
      towards each other, gave some slight explanation, and turned the
      conversation to other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madeline was not satisfied; she had noted the look which had passed
      between the pair, and it made her more curious than she had been before.
      What could it mean? There was some dark mystery about their life which she
      must discover, ere it led her into serious harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how to discover it? After long pondering she resolved to pick out from
      the innumerable guests who frequented her husband&rsquo;s table some man to whom
      she could speak freely, and to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolve made, she endeavoured to carry it out. Every night when,
      attired in clinging satin or velvet, she entered the luxurious dining-room
      by Madame de Fontenay&rsquo;s side, her eye travelled from one place to another,
      timidly looking for sympathy which never came. Although the guests would
      flatter and flirt with her, there was not one among them whom she felt she
      could really trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the days and weeks wore on, hopelessly, sadly, despite the glitter and
      gaudy show. Hope died within her heart; but suddenly it was revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, dearest, you did not tell me this morning whether or not you
      would do me the favour I asked of you?&rsquo; said Belleisle again that day
      after her drive was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked at him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish me to look well to-night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My charming little one, you do always look well,&rsquo; retorted the polite
      Frenchman. &lsquo;I wish you to look second to no lady in Paris.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, Monsieur. I will try.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A new guest to dress for; some new flatteries to listen to. The
      announcement was not novel, and yet Madeline felt that night as she had
      never felt before. She had a pleasure in dressing, a delight in watching
      herself grow more beautiful under the busy hands of her maid, and, when at
      length her toilet was complete, she sat with beating heart and heightened
      colour, as if awaiting the consummation of some great event.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the dining-room, as she had done hundreds of times before, by
      Madame de Fontenay&rsquo;s side. She bowed, and shook hands with all she knew,
      and then was introduced to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur le Marquis de Vaux&mdash;Mademoiselle de Fontenay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline inclined her head for a moment, then raising her eyes she saw
      that she was receiving a low bow and a deep blush from the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall fair young fellow, of some two- or three-and-twenty, looking more
      like an English lad than a French Marquis. Perhaps it was this English
      look which touched Madeline&rsquo;s heart and made her feel that glow of
      sympathy which she had waited for so long and thought would never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the dinner passed off that night Madeline never knew. She sat as one
      in a dream, eating little, listening to the busy hum of conversation about
      her, and ever conscious that a pair of feeble blue eyes were fixed upon
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, Madame de Fontenay rose, and Madeline, taking the hint,
      followed her from the room. She did not see any of the gentlemen again
      that night, and the widow did not leave her until it was time to retire to
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days passed. Every day she met the Marquis at dinner, and each
      time she met him his manner seemed to change. Whenever he shook hands he
      gave her fingers a slight pressure; sometimes his eyes, after diligently
      trying to meet hers, would fix upon her face a look full of strange
      inquiry, which she, not comprehending, could not reply to. Ere long his
      easy freshness wore off&mdash;his manner grew nervous and changeful, his
      cheeks pale and haggard; he seemed to become the slave of Belleisle, and
      at times glanced with almost terror-stricken eyes at Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it all mean? Every day Madeline grew more troubled, more sick
      at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had resolved to elicit an explanation from the nobleman, but she soon
      found that to be impossible. Now that she watched for an opportunity she
      saw that she had none. Although apparently a free agent, she was, in
      reality, a prisoner&mdash;guarded and carefully watched either by her
      husband or Madame de Fontenay. What was to be done? Speak to him she must
      and would; stratagem must be employed&mdash;but how?
    </p>
    <p>
      After long pondering and much thought, Madeline hit upon a plan which she
      thought might possibly succeed. Having got dressed for dinner one night,
      she dismissed her maid, and, before the widow could come for her,
      hurriedly wrote down the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Monsieur,&mdash;I would like to see you and speak with you alone.
      Please meet me to-morrow night at nine o&rsquo;clock in the lobby of the Hôtel
      Bellevue.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Madeline de Fontenay.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening when dinner was over and Madeline rose to follow Madame de
      Fontenay from the room, she deliberately shook hands with the Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Monsieur,&rsquo; she said softly; then her hand was timidly
      withdrawn, and the Marquis, with a bow, let his arm drop by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline retired early that night; the next morning she went her usual
      drive with her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was bitterly cold, for winter had set in, and Madeline, wrapped in
      furs, lay back in the carriage with flushed cheeks and feverishly
      sparkling eyes, and inhaled the chilly air with quick and feverish sigh*.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God only knows,&rsquo; she was thinking, &lsquo;what trouble this evening may bring;
      a few hours hence and I shall meet the Marquis, and, having met him, what
      can I say or do? I will throw myself upon his mercy&mdash;I will tell him
      the truth, and, in return, demand it of him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement the Marquis did not appear at dinner that night. She saw
      that Monsieur Belleisle was worried by his absence, and that Madame de
      Fontenay, too, seemed strangely ill at ease. Dinner was hurried over
      quickly, and the ladies retired. Having reached the drawing-room, Madeline
      threw herself into an easy chair and closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a headache,&rsquo; she said, in answer to Madame de Fontenay&rsquo;s anxious
      inquiries. &lsquo;I am feverish to-night, Madame, and I think I shall soon
      retire.&rsquo; And the widow, secretly glad of the opportunity of being alone
      that evening, kissed the girl on both her cheeks, and soon withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline was feverish. Now that the time was passing so quickly, the
      thought of her coming interview weighed upon her; but, having made the
      appointment, she was bound to keep it, or gravely compromise herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew aside her window curtain and looked out. It was a fair still
      night, but growing every hour still colder. She rang for her maid, and
      with her assistance took off her dinner dress, and clad herself in one of
      the plainest costumes she possessed. When she was dressed, ready to
      depart, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember, Augustine, my going out to-night is a secret both from my
      mother and Monsieur Belleisle. If they ask for me, say that I am still
      unwell, and have retired early to rest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the girl, who was doubtless in Belleisle&rsquo;s confidence, could reply
      or interfere, Madeline had hurried from the room, and was in the open
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of meeting was only a few minutes distant from the hotel where
      she was dwelling; she reached it just as the clock struck nine. As she
      entered the door she saw a gentleman standing with his back towards her&mdash;the
      only other living being in the great vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline approached him, questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned with an exclamation&mdash;she recoiled. The eyes looking so
      steadily into hers belonged to a face which she remembered well. She was
      face to lace with the young Englishman whom she had met on the night of
      her elopement from school.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ismayed at the
      unexpected encounter, Madeline gazed at the Englishman for a time in
      speechless confusion; then she turned her head and gazed helplessly
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle,&rsquo; said the young man, quietly, &lsquo;I fear you are not prepared
      for this meeting with me. Well, let me tell you I am here on an errand of
      duty, not pleasure. My friend, the Marquis de Vaux, has placed this affair
      entirely in my hands&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Monsieur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray do not interrupt me, Mademoiselle. I have little to say, so our
      interview can be brief&mdash;it will be better for us both. I had the
      pleasure of meeting you once before&mdash;only once, when I offered you my
      assistance, because I feared you needed some one to pluck you from the
      clutches of that Frenchman, in whose company you were staying at the
      hotel. But when I offered you my help I thought you were some pure-minded,
      misguided English girl. I did not know that you were the mistress of a
      scoundrel, and that you were making your way to Paris to become the decoy
      for a gambling hell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur! monsieur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, hear me out. &rsquo;Tis some weeks now since I discovered whither
      my seemingly virtuous English girl had flown. I have seen you driving in
      the crowded thoroughfares of Paris, smiling and bowing to the miserable
      wretches whom your smiles have brought to ruin. I saw you, and said
      nothing. Had you been discreet, I should have spared you. But since you
      seem to have no discretion, since you have thought it pastime to delude
      and cause the ruin of a friend of mine, I give you due notice I shall
      spare you no more. Here are the letters which from time to time you have
      written to my friend, and which your trusty servant has delivered for you.
      I give you two days to leave Paris with your protector; if, at the end of
      that time, you still linger here, I shall speak to the police, and let the
      law take its course.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not move; she stood like one turned to stone. In her hand she
      held a packet of letters, while the words &lsquo;decoy of a gambling hell&rsquo; rang
      with strange echoes in her brain. How long she stood there she did not
      know; the sharp breath of the night air brushing her cheek, as she
      tottered from the hotel, recalled her to herself. She shiveringly drew her
      cloak around her and walked&mdash;home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smart French maid was amazed to see her mistress back so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of the hand Madeline stopped all questioning and dismissed the
      girl for the night. Then she sat down to think. How her head ached! How
      cold and shivering and wretched she felt! Days and nights seemed to have
      gone by since she started off on her strange errand that evening. In
      reality <i>only</i> a few hours had passed. How those few hours had
      changed her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she remembered the packet which the Englishman had given her.
      She took it from her pocket, burst the band which held it, and the letters
      were scattered on her dressing-table. She took up one, opened it, and
      read, in what appeared to be her own handwriting&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Be not so hasty, my dear friend. I must break the news gently to my
      beloved mother, who cannot bear the thought of parting with me. Our
      behaviour in public must not alter, but be sure I adore you. A thousand
      greetings from Madeline.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Be cautious in your behaviour, and above all try to please the Vicomte,
      my cousin. Do anything he wishes you&mdash;it will come all right in the
      end. He has a stupid love of play&mdash;indulge him; if he wins from you
      he shall be made afterwards to restore.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline read the letters over and over again. She picked up several
      others, and found them all to be in the same tone&mdash;protestations of
      love for the Marquis and prayers to him not to offend Monsieur Belleisle,
      of whom, she avowed, she stood in the greatest fear&mdash;and the
      forgeries were so good as almost to deceive herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past was all clear to her now&mdash;she knew what she had done and
      what she was; she recognised the true worth of the man she had married,
      and of the woman who called herself her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do? whither should she go? For the first time in her life
      she could understand the feeling which prompted wretched outcast women to
      stand upon the parapet of a bridge and cast their miserable bodies into
      the depths of the blackened river; at least their woes would be ended&mdash;their
      weary bodies be at rest. She felt that such a death would be acceptable to
      her that night. Oh, if she could only leap into the darkness, and end it
      all!
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered up the letters, which still lay upon her table, threw off her
      bonnet, which lay like a weight upon her head, and opened her door. It was
      still early enough for Belleisle to be up. She would see him, speak to
      him; she could not wait another hour, with that newly acquired knowledge
      on he mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this idea she left her chamber, looked first into one room, then
      another&mdash;and was about to return to her own in despair, when she was
      arrested by the sound of voices, which she recognised as those of her
      husband and Madame de Fontenay. She paused and listened. The pair were
      closeted in Madame de Fontenay&rsquo;s private room, and their conversation was
      of an exciting nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline soon heard her own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emile, you are a fool,&rsquo; says Madame de Fontenay; &lsquo;why he stays away I
      know not. I only know that one little note from Madeline will bring him
      back again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if he comes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he comes, <i>mon ami</i>, you can win from him a few more hundreds,
      and then make a quarrel, refuse to give him the little one&rsquo;s hand, and rid
      yourself of him for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time they were silent, or spoke in undertones. Madeline was about to
      open the door and break up their converse, when the widow raised her voice
      and spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a fool,&rsquo; she said hotly, &lsquo;and although I advise you well, you, by
      your bungling, upset all my plans. Did I not advise you to provide for the
      future by entering a good school, and marrying, either by fair means or
      foul, the richest girl that the rich school contained? Yes. But you, like
      a fool, ran off with the poorest, and did your very best to ensure your
      own ruin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not know that the girl was poor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did not know! it was your duty, my friend, to ascertain that she was
      rich. Well, we need not complain now. Thanks to me again, the silly girl
      has been useful to you, and will be so again. Listen, then&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madeline, trembling outside, could bear it no longer; she turned the
      handle of the door, and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still wore her walking dress; her face was white as death, her hands
      trembling and cold; while her fingers closed nervously around the packet
      of letters which she held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay, who believed that her dupe was quietly sleeping, gave
      a little scream; Belleisle started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, <i>diable!</i> what brings you here?&rsquo; he exclaimed, thrown off
      his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Madeline did not answer him. She stood apparently calm and
      collected, but with a face whiter than that of the dead, fixing her large
      blue eyes upon first one and then another of the faces before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a villain!&rsquo; she said at length, walking steadily up to Monsieur
      Belleisle; &lsquo;you have tried by cruel, cold-blooded falsehood to compass my
      ruin; you have nearly succeeded, but, thank God, I have found you out at
      last.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Livid with rage, and completely taken off his guard, Belleisle stood with
      clenched fists, as if ready to strike his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Fontenay stepped forward to restrain him, but Madeline stood her
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not think to frighten me,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;those days are past, Monsieur
      Belleisle; though you were fifty times my husband, you shall be punished
      for all that you have done to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, my love, be reasonable,&rsquo; said Madame de Fontenay, &lsquo;you are
      under some misapprehension&mdash;let me explain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let <i>you</i> explain, Madame! you did that admirably to Monsieur
      Belleisle before I entered the room. I know that you are the cause of all
      this evil; I know it is through your wicked prompting that Monsieur
      Belleisle has been induced to make me what I am; I know that you have
      plotted together to bring about the ruin of a poor girl who never did you
      harm. With regard to you I am powerless, but upon that man, if there is
      any justice in the world, I will be revenged.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Belleisle had partly recovered his composure. He walked up to
      the angry girl, and asked quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How will you be revenged? Tell me that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will prosecute you for forgery; you wrote these letters to the Marquis
      de Vaux; you forged Mr. White&rsquo;s writing, and sent a letter to me; he shall
      prosecute you too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Belleisle turned whiter still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a new sensation in court,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;a young English girl
      prosecuting her French paramour. It would give you notoriety doubtless,
      Mademoiselle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I say&mdash;you are not my wife, thank God. I was by no means such a
      fool as you think, Mademoiselle. I went through a mock ceremony with you&mdash;thinking
      I would have a real one if I found your fortune was worth the sacrifice. I
      found it was not; therefore I have pleasure in informing you that you are
      free.&mdash;After all, there is not very much harm done, Mademoiselle, and
      it may give you pleasure to know that by gracing my table with your
      presence, and smiling upon my guests, you have been the means of bringing
      some money to me. No one but my good aunt knows that you have been my
      mistress&mdash;and with her I am sure your secret is safe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Madeline was silent; so, after a pause, Belleisle continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that I have explained you will perceive, I am sure, the necessity for
      silence. If you dare to make a scene I shall tell the whole story, and I
      will bring dozens of witnesses to prove that you played very willingly
      into my hands. If you are silent, I too will be silent. You can go to
      England, marry an Englishman, and become a model English wife&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman paused, for Madeline, uttering a low moan, at last sank
      swooning upon the floor.

      CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;THE BARS BROKEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Madeline
      recovered her senses she was lying upon her bed, with her maid bending
      anxiously above her. As she opened her eyes the girl uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, thank God, you have awakened, dear Mademoiselle. I feared your eyes
      were closed for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, without replying, Madeline only closed her eyes and became insensible
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was happening nobody knew, and the servants became very alarmed. It
      was strange, they thought, that at such a time, when the young lady was
      sick to death, her mother and cousin should leave the house; and yet they
      had gone, and had only just left a little note for Mademoiselle. It was
      well for Madeline that her own maid was kindly. She kept by her mistress&rsquo;s
      side, although, one by one, the other servants fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after the departure of Monsieur Belleisle, a strange English
      gentleman called at the hotel and asked for him. On being told that he was
      gone, and that the only occupant of the rooms now was a young lady who was
      supposed to be dying, he asked to be allowed to see her, and was conducted
      at once to Madeline&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man walked up the stairs with the memory of his last meeting
      with the girl still in his mind. He felt very bitter against her, but the
      moment he entered the room where she was lying his bitterness melted away.
      How pale and ill she looked! How wasted, wretched, and sad! He bent for a
      moment to sadly regard the unconscious face, he pressed the wasted hand,
      felt the pulse; then turned to the maid, who stood looking on in mute
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madeline was apparently prosperous, she did not enter into his
      calculations at all. Once, when he thought her in need of help, he had
      offered it&mdash;now, when he knew her to be in need, he gave it. By a few
      well-applied questions he extracted from the maid such facts as, coupled
      with those in his own knowledge, gave him a pretty correct idea of how
      things stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still believed Madeline to be culpable&mdash;there was nothing to
      convince him to the contrary; but she was a countrywoman in distress, and
      he was still man enough to assist her. He announced his intention of
      looking after her, until such time as her relations could be communicated
      with and she could be left in proper hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He provided a proper doctor, and sent a professional nurse to share the
      vigils of Madeline&rsquo;s French maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during these nights of nursing that the poor parched lips of the
      invalid muttered words which astonished the Englishman. For, little by
      little, word by word, she told him all. Sometimes she called on Belleisle
      for mercy, begging him to take her back to school; then she reproached him
      for having forced her into a marriage; then she cried and sobbed, vowing
      vehemently that she was his wife. She spoke again and again of the forged
      letters to the Marquis de Vaux; then she cried passionately, saying she
      could never face her guardian any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delirious people never lie,&rsquo; said the young man to himself one evening,
      as he stood by the bed, plaintively regarding the pale, pinched face. &lsquo;If
      she had not been so ill I could not have extracted so much from her by
      days of cross-questioning. Poor, misguided, miserable child&mdash;another
      instance of the martyrdom of woman to the treachery of man. God help her!
      God help her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having told this much, Madeline told more. By interrogating her during her
      saner moments, he learned that her guardian was a Mr. White, who lived in
      a studio in St. John&rsquo;s Wood. He risked sending a telegram, and somewhat to
      his amazement got a reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless you for the information. I am starting for Paris forthwith.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having read the telegram, which came to his lodgings, he folded it, put it
      in his pocket, and walked up to the house where Madeline still lay. Good
      news awaited him there. The maid&rsquo;s face was very bright, and the cause of
      that brightness was that Mademoiselle had awakened, taken some
      nourishment, and fallen into a natural sleep. The fever had abated, and
      the doctor said that the crisis was now past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would Monsieur like to see Mademoiselle?*
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not mention to her that I have been here at all. But there will
      be an English gentleman here to-morrow, whom she will be glad to see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arranged everything to his satisfaction, he returned to his
      lodgings, sat down before a roaring wood fire, lit a cigar, and began to
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      His watching was at an end; his long, sad looks at Madeline were over;
      and, to his own surprise, he felt a sort of regret. During the last few
      days he had never been free from self-reproach. He had met her at a time
      when his help might have saved her&mdash;yet, because she repulsed him, he
      had quietly stood aloof and let her drift to her ruin. Yes, although his
      reason told him he was not to blame, in his own mind he felt culpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was all over now; self-accusation and recrimination would never
      obliterate that dark past from the girl&rsquo;s life&mdash;she must live and
      suffer&mdash;but he vowed to himself that it should be his endeavour to
      make that suffering easy for her to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that night he slept little, but when he did sleep he dreamed of
      Madeline. Now he clasped her in his arms and plunged with her into wild
      waters&mdash;again he drew her from some darkly surging river, or with
      uplifted knife stood waiting to plunge it into the heart of the grinning
      Frenchman. He was glad when daylight relieved him from such dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first care was to ascertain how his charge was thriving. The report
      was favourable again; she had passed a peaceful night, and in the morning
      she had lain for half an hour talking rationally to her maid. She heard
      with perfect equanimity of the departure and continued absence of Madame
      de Fontenay and Monsieur Belleisle. She opened and read the letter which
      Monsieur had left for her, then quietly burned it in the candle which
      stood beside her bed. She thanked her maid for her kindness, said she must
      be removed from that place, and then dropped into an exhausted sleep
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well satisfied with the account, the young man again returned home to
      await the arrival of Mr. White. In the afternoon White came. &rsquo;Twas
      no other, of course, than our old acquaintance, but so changed that his
      nearest friend would hardly know him. His cheeks were ghastly, his eyes
      sunken, his hair and beard unkempt, and his clothes in a deplorable
      condition with the long and tedious travel. Despite his disreputable
      appearance, however, the young man&rsquo;s heart went out to him at once. He
      gave him a cordial welcome, and tenderly told him all that he knew about
      his ward. In return, White gave his confidence, and then the two men
      walked together to the house where Madeline lay. White&rsquo;s hands trembled,
      his cheeks turned very pale, when the maid came to conduct him to
      Madeline&rsquo;s room. He went up alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the lower salons the other awaited his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour passed, then another; he read one, read all the papers, walked
      restless up and down in growing excitement&mdash;till White returned to
      him, with cheeks more pinched and ghastly than they had been before, and
      pitiful tears in his eyes. He laid his tremulous hand upon the young man&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has sobbed herself to sleep,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Would you like to see her
      now?&rsquo; The other, unable to resist, went again into the room where Madeline
      lay. She was quite unconscious of his presence, in a deep but troubled
      sleep. Her loose fair hair was scattered upon the pillow&mdash;her breath
      came in short quick pants, which sometimes turned to sobs. Upon one hand
      her cheek was resting, the other lay carelessly upon the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man raised her hand gently, and pressed it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;God knows if we shall meet again!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;IMOGEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ehind the scenes
      of the Royal Parthenon Theatre, on a sultry evening in July. The first act
      of the play was over, and the carpenters were busy setting and preparing
      the scenes for the next act, while Hart, the stage manager, stood
      perspiring under his white hat with his back to the curtain. Figures in
      all kinds of costumes coming and going; female voices chattering, and male
      voices grumbling, made the confusion worse confounded, when Abrahams, the
      manager, sumptuously attired in a dress suit which might have been
      borrowed from a slop-shop in Hounds-ditch, came panting on to the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he asked, gazing at Hart with a bloodshot, questioning eye; &lsquo;is it
      a go, will she do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage manager was too old a bird to commit himself so early in the
      evening, but he answered off-hand, with one eye on the carpenters, the
      other on his employer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she will; what do they say in front?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say! They&rsquo;re in ecstasies. Cakeford says she is the biggest thing he&rsquo;s
      seen since Desclée. Why the devil doesn&rsquo;t Brady act up to her? Well, it&rsquo;ll
      depend now on her legs&mdash;if her legs are all right when she comes on
      as the boy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s in Act III.?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, in Act III. Hay says she&rsquo;s too thin, but didn&rsquo;t she have them in the
      garden scene? It was splendid. Well, I&rsquo;m going to speak to her, and tell
      her the impression she has made. I think it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the manager pushed his way across the stage, and, winding in
      and out among set pieces, wings, loose pieces of canvas, and all the
      flotsam and jetsam of the theatre, made his way along a dirty passage till
      he came to a dingy door which stood ajar. Here he knocked, and, without
      waiting for an invitation, entered a largish chamber, hastily fitted up as
      an actress&rsquo;s retiring room. Mirrors in various degrees of magnificent
      dinginess were hung on every side; a large gilded sofa, occasionally used
      on the stage in so-called &lsquo;banqueting&rsquo; scenes, stood in a corner, chairs
      of divers gaudy patterns were scattered here and there, and in the centre
      was a white table with gilded legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the further end of the room were drawn crimson curtains, communicating
      with the more private portion of the dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo, White, here you are!&rsquo; exclaimed the manager to a solitary figure
      sitting on the gilded sofa, and smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic author (for it was he) rose and seized the manager&rsquo;s hand.
      His own was trembling like a leaf, and his eyes were dim with moisture
      very like tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, then?&rsquo; he said eagerly, almost pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she goes on as she has begun she&rsquo;ll astonish the town. Ah, here she
      is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the curtains were drawn back by the hand of a female
      attendant, and the heroine of the evening appeared, clad in her &lsquo;change&rsquo;
      for the second act&mdash;an exquisite dress of white samite thinly
      embroidered with silver. Locks of flaxen hair fell loosely over her
      shoulders, and set in its midst was a face of the most dream-like and
      spiritual beauty, lit by two large eyes which, once seen, were never to be
      forgotten. In another woman perhaps those eyes might have seemed too pale,
      too forget-me-not like in hue, but in her they harmonised strangely with
      the wonderful hair and tremulous mobile lips. Tall, slight, and yet finely
      and even fully formed, the actress was in the prime of her womanhood, and
      as she advanced with eyes full of limpid light and mouth tremulously
      smiling, she looked supremely bright and fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet despite her loveliness and despite her air of evanescent happiness,
      there was something in her look, and still more in her manner, which
      seemed full of nameless trouble. There was too quick an attempt to seem
      unrestrained and gay, too strange a readiness to seize light occasions for
      nervous laughter, too impatient a sense of her own beauty, and of the
      light sparkling upon it. Her very gesture at times was at once imperious
      and reckless; she seemed like one who commands, yet shrinks from the
      obedience of, some wild animal crouching at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was strangest of all, she seemed suddenly, in the midst of her gayest
      laughter, to pause with a kind of listening terror, while the light faded
      from her eyes, and the sickness of a nameless horror touched every feature
      of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be supposed that these fluctuations of feeling would at once
      have struck any one but a very close observer. To the ordinary eye, such
      as that of Abrahams, hers was simply a lovely face, characterised by
      marvellous lights and shades of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced smiling into the room, and held out both her hands to White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. White,&rsquo; she said, with something of her childish manner, &lsquo;I am so
      glad you have come round.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White took both her hands and held them tenderly in his own, while the
      manager beamed and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you feel, my dear?&rsquo; asked the latter. &lsquo;Nerves all right, eh? Shall
      I send you up some champagne?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you; I never drink wine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And right you are,&rsquo; said Abrahams. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the curse of the profession, and
      death to a pretty face. Look at Mrs. Claudesley! She was the talk of the
      town for a whole season, and yet she drank herself to death. The very year
      she died they offered her one hundred pounds a night to star in the
      States, and if she had gone and kept sober she might have come back with
      twenty thousand pounds.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The actress was not listening, her smile had faded, and she was gazing
      with strange wistfulness into White&rsquo;s face. She did not speak; but her
      look said something more significant than words, something that filled his
      eyes and throat with tears, and misted the glasses of his spectacles. He
      squeezed her little fingers in his trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy I am,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;More than happy; proud! This
      is a great night for all of us&mdash;a great night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think so?&rsquo; she returned sweetly; &lsquo;then I am quite satisfied. I don&rsquo;t
      care for what the others think; I only want to please <i>you!</i>&rsquo; and
      though her eyes were quite dry, she passed her hands lightly across them,
      as if brushing away a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abrahams looked at her with growing admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How about the big scene in Act III.?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Do you feel quite up to
      it, my dear? Well, that&rsquo;s right; and what White here says <i>I</i> say&mdash;this
      will be a great night for all of us, if you only finish as you&rsquo;ve begun.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a rap at the door and a shrill voice, &lsquo;Overture&rsquo;s finished,
      Miss Vére;&rsquo; whereupon the three, still in conversation, moved slowly
      towards the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was &lsquo;Cymbeline,&rsquo; and it was &lsquo;Miss Vere&rsquo;s&rsquo; first appearance in the
      character of &lsquo;Imogen.&rsquo; The regular season at the Parthenon being over, and
      the eminent tragedian who was generally its chief ornament being away in
      the provinces, Abrahams had been persuaded to try the new actress in an
      unfamiliar Shakespearian character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, as is usual in such cases, the play was &lsquo;scamped.&rsquo; All the old
      scenery of the theatre was called into requisition, and the costumes were
      a startling combination of all the early periods. This gave the critics of
      the daily newspapers an opportunity of saying, next morning, that &lsquo;the new
      and appropriate scenery was everything that could be desired, and that the
      strictest accuracy was observed in the minutest detail of properties and
      costumes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the play-going public had come that night not to see the fine scenery
      or good costumes, not to listen to the dreary spouting of the members of
      the stock company, but to witness the first London appearance of a young
      lady of whom rumour had prophesied great things. The house was crammed
      with &lsquo;paper.&rsquo; The critics of the big papers sat in the stalls, and the
      critics of the small papers were sprinkled through the dress circle.
      Literature, art, and the drama were well represented. Sir Tilbury Swallow,
      who had married the once famous actress, Miss Fawn, and who had been
      knighted for his literary services by the reigning family, occupied a
      private box with his still beautiful wife. Professional beauties, of less
      conspicuous virtue, shone resplendent everywhere. Deep in a stall, buried
      in the abyss of his own personality, and glaring thence occasionally, with
      saturnine cheek and lack-lustre eye, sat the great Mr. Blanco Serena, the
      pre-Raphaelite painter. The fact was, nearly every individual present in
      the better parts of the house possessed, or was supposed to possess, some
      sort of interest in dramatic, pictorial, or literary art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the stalls, however, sat a figure whose appearance was in
      striking contrast to that of the habitual theatre-goers surrounding him.
      In any gathering he would have attracted attention; in the present he was
      specially remarkable. He was a broad-shouldered muscular man of about
      thirty, with a face bronzed to a deep brown by exposure to the tropical
      sun. He had a high forehead, black eyes, a square, determined jaw; a
      thick, black moustache covered his upper lip, but his cheeks were clean
      shaven. Even in his well-made dress suit, with faultless linen and
      spotless tie, he had the appearance of a man whose true place would be
      leading a forlorn hope or standing alone in some position of loneliness
      and peril. He sat and listened, or rose and looked about him between the
      acts, with the air of one to whom a theatre was more or less unfamiliar,
      and he listened to the whole play, even to the ranting of the subordinate
      actors, with the approval of a man enjoying a new sensation, and quite
      unable or unwilling to be dissatisfied or critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the first moment the new actress appeared upon the stage this man
      had watched her in fascinated amazement, and as long as she remained there
      he had eyes for nothing else but her face. As the play proceeded, his
      expression changed from one of wonder and doubt to another of deep
      surprise and pain. His brows were knitted, his countenance strangely
      troubled. When the curtain fell on the first act he sat moveless, and made
      no attempt to join in the general applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the second act he remained in the same position, troubled and
      expectant. When it ended he rose quietly, and made his way to the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Various excited groups were congregated here. One group, consisting of
      several very young gentlemen, a little bald-headed man with a simpering
      voice, and a swarthy lean man wrapt up to the throat in a large white
      muffler, clearly representing the fourth estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lean man in the muffler was holding forth with more zeal than
      eloquence on the personal appearance of the <i>débutante</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did she come from?&rsquo; asked one of the very young gentlemen. &lsquo;Where
      did Abrahams pick her up?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that her parents lived in Paris,&rsquo; answered the lean man, &lsquo;and
      that she used to sing once, when quite a young girl, at a <i>café chantant</i>.
      White knows all about her, I believe.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What power she showed in the cave scene!&rsquo; said another very young
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; the lean man said, reflectively. &lsquo;She rather
      disappointed me there. And I don&rsquo;t like her delivery of the blank verse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beastly immoral play!&rsquo; drawled the man with the bald head. &lsquo;What the
      French call <i>scabreux?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Shakespeare,&rsquo; gasped one of the very young gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure of that? And if it is? Shakespeare or no Shakespeare, the
      licenser would suppress it if it were submitted to him now for the first
      time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, oh!&rsquo; groaned several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is more,&rsquo; persisted the man with the bald head, &lsquo;no manager
      could look at such rubbish. It&rsquo;s very good poetry, and all that sort of
      thing, but it&rsquo;s what I call a&mdash;&mdash;bad play, though you fellows
      haven&rsquo;t the pluck to say so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of the Imogen?&rsquo; asked the lean man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty good,&rsquo; drawled, the other. &lsquo;When I was an <i>attache</i> in
      Constantinople, I once saw a woman&rsquo;s hand waving out of a house on the
      Bosphorus. I jumped out of my boat, and went into the house, tripping an
      eunuch at the door who tried to prevent me. I ran from room to room till I
      came to a splendid open court with a fountain, and there I saw a veiled
      woman sitting in the sun. The moment I appeared she lifted up the veil,
      and showed the loveliest face I ever saw. I need not give you the sequel
      of the story. She had seen me at a distance, and been struck by my style
      of beauty. I afterwards found she was the favourite wife of the Grand
      Vizier. Well, she was the very image of the girl who is playing &ldquo;Imogen&rdquo;
       tonight. Poor little Schelsalmaigàr.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was that her name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; old Muzid afterwards found out about my visits, and the cruel
      bowstring and sack business terminated the adventure. I tried to save her,
      but they found some of my Turkish letters (I write Turkish rather better
      than I write English) on her person. She kept them too long, in the hopes
      of getting some one to read them to her, for she couldn&rsquo;t read herself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing close to the group the swarthy gentleman with the moustache had
      listened to the close with a smile as he sipped a glass of lemonade.
      Suddenly he felt himself touched upon the shoulder, while a hasty voice
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Sutherland! is it possible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning quietly, he found himself face to face with a bright-eyed,
      full-bearded little man of forty, who used an eye-glass, and spoke with
      the greatest suspicion of a Scottish accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crieff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned the little man. &lsquo;But is it yourself? How long have you been
      in England?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just one month,&rsquo; said Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I last heard of you, you were somewhere in the wilds of North
      America. There was a paragraph going round that you had joined a Free-love
      community in the Western States. Well, of all the places in the world, the
      last I should expect to find you in is a theatre. Do you like the new
      actress?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not a very good judge of acting,&rsquo; replied Sutherland, quietly; &lsquo;but
      if you mean do I like her personally&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it comes to that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I think she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say that!&rsquo; said the little man, opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only once in my life before, and that was years ago, under extraordinary
      circumstances, have I seen such a face. Should it be the same&mdash;but
      no, that is scarcely possible. Do you know anything of Miss Vere&rsquo;s
      history?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, it is not her first appearance on the stage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not. She has had some years of practice in the provinces. If you
      are interested in the lady, come and sup with me to-night at the
      Harum-Scarum.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A club of night-birds, where the small critics compare their notes and
      pick each other&rsquo;s brains for ideas. The strongest will and the loudest
      voice settle the matter, and what they say overnight is echoed in a dozen
      newspapers next morning.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what has that to do with Miss Vere?&rsquo; i Everything. You&rsquo;ll hear all
      that is known concerning her, for the night-birds know everything, and&mdash;but
      the curtain&rsquo;s going up. Of course you&rsquo;ll come?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sutherland; and the two men returned to their places in the
      auditorium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act was a revelation and a surprise, even to those who believed
      most in the new actress. In the great scene with Pisanio, when, on her way
      to Milford Haven, Imogen learns for the first time her husband&rsquo;s
      diabolical suspicions, the actress fairly took the house by storm, till,
      at the great speech ending:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">
      Prithee dispatch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The lamb entreats the butcher; where&rsquo;s thy knife?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Thou art too slow to do thy master&rsquo;s bidding,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When I deserve it, too!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      the whole audience rose in one surge of vehement applause. Pale as death,
      with her large eyes gleaming, and her delicate frame trembling like a
      leaf, Miss Vere trembled before the unexpected tempest, and it was some
      minutes before the scene could proceed. When it did so the actress seemed
      moved to the quick, and the pensive wail:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Talk thy tongue weary; speak
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I have heard. I am a strumpet; and mine ear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Therein false struck, can make no greater wound,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor tent to bottom that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      was uttered with a melancholy so infinite, pathos so despairing, that
      Sutherland, who had heard the excitement and enthusiasm, felt the words
      sink like lead into his heart. His own face was livid now, despite its
      tan, and a shiver ran through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene or two later, when Imogen is transformed into
    </p>
    <p>
      Fidele, the actress still held her audience, but with a less mysterious
      fascination. In her boy&rsquo;s dress, which was charmingly delicate and
      becoming, she fully warranted the exclamation of Belarius on first
      beholding her:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      No elder than a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her acting, moreover, was pathetic in the extreme; and thenceforth, until
      the end of the play, her success was assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain fell. Call after call greeted the actress, who looked
      completely exhausted by her efforts, and could scarcely conjure up a
      smile, as she accepted the bouquets which had been liberally provided for
      her. White sat in the dark background of a box, crying for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the audience streamed out of the theatre, Sutherland came shoulder to
      shoulder with little Crieff, who had invited him to sup at the
      Harum-Scarum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How glum you look!&rsquo; said Crieff. &lsquo;Are you disappointed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disappointed, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to share the general enthusiasm?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do share it, but, as I told you, I am no judge of acting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, come and hear what the night-birds say about it. Shall we walk to
      the club? It&rsquo;s only a few streets off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arm-in-arm in the moonlight the two men walked away. Sutherland had
      lighted a cigar, and now, while the other chattered, he scarcely uttered a
      word.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;THE HARUM-SCARUMS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. J. Watson
      Crieff was assistant editor of the &lsquo;Charing Cross Chronicle,&rsquo; an evening
      newspaper devoted to smart writing and the conservation of Church and
      State. He was a hard-working Scotchman, with no pretensions to literary
      attainments, but honourably connected with journalism in many ways. He was
      not a regular theatre-goer, still less a professed critic, but he
      sometimes, as on the present occasion, went to see a Shakespearian
      performance, and wrote about it afterwards honestly and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing along the Strand, he led his friend down a street running at right
      angles to the banks of the Thames, and soon entered the dingy building
      where the Harum-Scarums were accustomed to hold high festival. Proceeding
      upstairs, he entered a large room, at one end of which was a fire and a
      silver grill, presided over by a man-cook dressed in white. The room was
      becoming crowded by men of all degrees and ages, clean-shaven actors and
      hirsute journalists having the preponderance, and more than one greeted
      Crieff by name. He soon found a table, and ordered a plain supper for
      himself and friend. A loud chatter filled the air, and every one was
      talking of the <i>débutante</i> at the Parthenon. Among the other faces
      around him Sutherland at once recognised the very young gentleman and the
      lean man in the muffler whom he had heard discoursing at the theatre
      saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Crieff quietly. &lsquo;The jury are bringing in an
      unanimous verdict of &ldquo;successful.&rdquo; I think I shall abuse her in the
      &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; just to show I&rsquo;ve a mind of my own.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll call you out!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Abrahams the manager, button-holing Day of the &ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; and rolling
      his eyes in well-feigned enthusiasm. If you watch him, you&rsquo;ll see him take
      the jury seriatim, and go through the same performance with every one of
      them. I thought so! He&rsquo;s ordering champagne.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that gentleman?&rsquo; asked Sutherland, glancing towards the next
      table, where a little bald-headed man, surrounded by many admiring
      friends, was trifling with the cruet. Sutherland had recognised the
      individual who, in the saloon of the theatre, had introduced the little
      anecdote of his amours in Constantinople.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know him? That&rsquo;s Lagardère, of the &ldquo;Plain Speaker.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! A journal, I presume?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>The</i> journal of the period, based
      upon the new principle of extenuating nothing and setting down everything
      in malice. Lagardère can tell you to a nicety where La Perichole buys her
      false teeth, how much money Mrs. Harkaway Spangle pays her washerwoman
      weekly, and when any given leader of society is likely to pawn her
      diamonds or elope with her cook. You know Tennyson&rsquo;s lines&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A lie which is all a lie can be met with and fought with outright,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But a lie which is half a truth is a harder matter to fight!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagardère has achieved the complete art of so mingling truth and falsehood
      together that it is impossible even for himself to distinguish the one
      from the other. What wine will you take?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None. I am a water drinker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still! Well, you thrive upon the crystal draught. Hallo, what&rsquo;s Lagardère
      romancing about now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the gentleman in question was leaning back in his chair, and
      in his peculiar drawl, to the edification of his immediate friends and
      admirers, speaking as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was with the army in Schleswig-Holstein, the Hereditary Duke of
      Schlagberg-Schwangau lived in the same hotel, and there was an English
      girl stopping with him, disguised as a young officer. The Duke laid a
      wager that this girl would smoke more cigars than I could in the course of
      twelve hours. Bismarck, who dropped in by accident, held the stakes. We
      began at six p.m. and smoked on till four in the morning, when the girl
      gave in and had to be carried off to bed. I mention the fact because she
      was exactly the same height as the girl who acted to-night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible! Can&rsquo;t be the same!&rsquo; said some one, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m sure. But it&rsquo;s the same sort of face, and the girl, when
      you provided her with champagne, used to recite splendidly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long was this ago, Lagardère?&rsquo; asked Crieff, leaning over towards the
      other table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About twelve years. The date is fixed in my memory, because it was the
      year I fought the duel with the Austrian general at Vienna.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crieff smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we put down Miss Vere&rsquo;s age at four-and-twenty (I
      believe she&rsquo;s scarcely twenty-two), she must have been, at the period you
      name, exactly twelve years old.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh greeted this retort; but the journalist was not at all
      disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see these sort of women are all so much alike,&rsquo; he drawled. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      seen the same type of face in the harem at Stamboul, among the
      nautch-dancers of India, and at the Jardin Mabille.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland, who had with difficulty kept his temper during this little
      scene, now turned his dusky eyes full on Lagardère.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by these sort of women?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagardère shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I meant was simply this, sir. Just as we recognise in certain faces
      the Jewish physiognomy; just as we see in certain religious orders the
      ascetic or separatist experience; just as in another way we distinguish
      the blood of the racehorse, or the breed of the greyhound, so we recognise
      in a certain type of women the type of the hetairai. The type is so
      uniform on the stage that if we take up a whole album of theatrical
      beauties, we shall find the features of a family, the characteristics of
      twin sisters.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to understand,&rsquo; said Sutherland, still retaining his
      self-possession, &lsquo;that in Miss Vere you recognise the type of woman
      without virtue?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; drawled Lagardère. &lsquo;Observe, I am making no personal
      accusation. If the lady is a friend of yours&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if she is, Mr. Lagardère, since that is your name&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, I envy your luck, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; returned Lagardère, with an
      ugly smile; and there was a general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland&rsquo;s hands came down, and they were clenched as if for a blow; but
      Crieff placed a warning hand upon his arm, and drew him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself/ he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only Lagardère.&rsquo; &lsquo;The man is
      insufferable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everybody knows that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He deserves to be horsewhipped.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you, he has been horsewhipped over and over again; I think he
      rather likes it, and whenever it occurs he publishes a full account in his
      own journal. Come, you&rsquo;re no match for him, with his poisoned shafts. He&rsquo;d
      find out the weak point in your armour at once. Come to the smoking-room,
      and have a cigar.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the room together, they heard the voice of Lagardère
      beginning again, with its usual drawling monotony&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Day, who&rsquo;s the fire-eater with Crieff? He reminds me of a man who
      once threatened to thrash me at St. Petersburg. It began at a card-party,
      where four of us were playing&mdash;the Grand Duke Nicolas, Prince
      Necrolowski, old Gortschenkoff, and myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard no more. Sutherland strode on to the smoking-room, which was
      almost empty, and threw himself into a seat. His face was convulsed, and
      his frame shook with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sutherland, you&rsquo;re exciting yourself for nothing. What is Miss
      Vere to you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is this much,&rsquo; said Sutherland, &lsquo;that if I thought it would serve her
      I would kill that man like a dog.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kill Lagardère! Ridiculous! Why, he&rsquo;s excellent fun.&rsquo; &lsquo;Crieff, don&rsquo;t talk
      like that&mdash;it&rsquo;s not worthy of you. You know that man is a villain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He only talks as most men do when actresses are in question, and I assure
      you he is a man of experience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Experience!&rsquo; echoed Sutherland bitterly. &lsquo;Yes, he has rolled in the
      shambles like the rest of us; he has polluted his body and his soul, and
      because he knows pollution, he dares to speak of one who is perhaps a
      martyr, and is, to him, an angel to a devil. Well, you are right, he only
      talks like the rest. Crieff, when I think of what that man is, of what
      most of us are, I hate my life, I wish I had never been born.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you go on like this, old fellow, I shall think you are in love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With my own ideal, yes. With that woman, though she almost realises it,
      no.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Crieff, earnestly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re too good stuff to
      be wasted on an actress.5
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There again. You, too, sneer at one whose soul you cannot comprehend.
      Crieff, neither you nor I am worthy to tie that woman&rsquo;s shoestrings. Grant
      that her life has been evil&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not believe it, but assume it for
      the moment&mdash;what she has been society has made her. If she has
      fallen, it has been through the lusts of our accursed sex; and even now,
      her divine face, in its almost supernatural sorrow and sweetness, rebukes
      our lusts and puts our wicked experiences to shame. Oh, we men, we men! We
      who talk of purity, and seek it in our mothers and our wives! What are we?
      What are our lives? Sinks of foul passion, privileged by society and
      protected by the spirit of the law. I tell you, until a man&rsquo;s life is as
      pure as he would have the life of the woman he loves, he has no right to
      throw one stone at the most fallen woman in the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for the space of some minutes. The two men smoked their
      cigars&mdash;Sutherland looking at vacancy, Crieff watching his face. The
      latter broke silence first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s more in this than you&rsquo;ve yet told me. Are you sure you have seen
      Miss Vere to-night for the first time!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but she is the ghost of a woman I once saw.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pause, then Crieff spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what, the best thing you can do is to make her acquaintance.
      Shall I ask Abrahams to introduce you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To his friend&rsquo;s surprise, Sutherland turned upon him a look of the
      uttermost consternation, and then said in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;A PAINTER&rsquo;S MODEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the public
      were busy discussing the merits and demerits of the star which had shone
      forth so suddenly upon the theatrical horizon, the lady herself was
      sitting in her dressing-room, apparently indifferent to all that passed or
      was likely to come. Her theatrical splendour had been cast off, and,
      enveloped now in a plain dark dress, she sat with dishevelled hair and
      pale cheeks, gazing dreamily at her own reflection in a mirror. Her maid,
      who was busily engaged in folding a delicate robe, was suddenly
      interrupted in her work by a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened it and admitted White. He walked over to the dreamy girl, put
      his arm round her shoulders, and kissed her fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here I am,&rsquo; he said quickly, with a glance at the busy, listening
      maid. &lsquo;Are you almost ready to come home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite ready,&rsquo; returned Madeline, awakening from her dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose at once, coiled up her hair, put on her hat and cloak, and, after
      giving a few directions to her maid, took White&rsquo;s arm and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house had been emptied and darkened, and the curtain raised, but
      confusion still prevailed upon the stage. Carpenters, scene-shifters,
      property men, actors and actresses, bereft of their splendour, all
      gathered according to their different grades around Abrahams, Hart, and
      the acting manager, who were holding forth like the outer world upon the
      merits of the heroine of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline, plainly dressed, thickly veiled, and clinging closely to White&rsquo;s
      arm, hoped to pass unseen through the crowd; but no sooner had she reached
      the centre of the stage than the keen eye of the manager fell upon her,
      and he advanced with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Miss Vere,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;allow me to congratulate you on a big
      success. You&rsquo;ve hit &rsquo;em right between the eyes, my dear. You have,
      by Jove!
    </p>
    <p>
      I always said you would. Didn&rsquo;t I always say you would?&rsquo; And turning to
      White, he added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;White, old man, dine with me to-morrow at five sharp. I&rsquo;ve a lot to talk
      over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline received the homage quietly enough, and by a slight pressure of
      her hand upon the arm of her delighted guardian hurried him along out
      through the stage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm still night, the sky was studded with stars; not a breath of
      air was stirring, but the noise in the streets was deafening, the
      confusion bewildering. A crowd was gathered round the theatre door, cabs
      rattled up and down, streams of people moved hither and thither, as if in
      a feverish dream. Once in the open air, White paused to hail a cab, but
      Madeline stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us walk,&rsquo; she said quickly. &lsquo;I am so excited, and a breath of this
      cool air will do me good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please, my dear,&rsquo; returned White, and, clasping her hand more
      firmly upon his arm, he led her through the ever-moving crowd. What a
      crowd it was! Men and women, old and young, rich and poor, mingling
      together in one perpetual eddy; shivering, starving, half-clad children;
      brazen street-walkers disporting in finery even more tawdry than that
      which the actress had cast aside, and pale-faced outcasts glaring ghastly
      beneath the gaslight, clutching at their rags, and forcing their parched
      heated lips to offer up a curse to Him who had made them what they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still veiled, still clinging closely to White&rsquo;s arms, Madeline passed
      slowly on, watching the crowd surging up and down beside her, seeing the
      faces pale, haggard, gaunt, and famine-stricken, flashing like phantoms.
      Now and then, as some weary woman passed beneath the glare of the
      gaslight, Madeline would pause and instinctively stretch forth her hand,
      as if to offer succour; but White, tightening his hold upon her, soothed
      the strange agitation which he knew to be rising, and firmly urged her on.
      Thus they left the trouble and the turmoil behind them, and passing into a
      sequestered square, with green trees around them, and the starlit heaven
      above, paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline raised her veil, and looked upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To think,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that such a bright sky should shine upon so much
      wickedness and sorrow! I wonder if any people are ever happy until they
      die?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happy! Of course they are. But come, we are lingering too long. I mean to
      drink a bottle of champagne to-night to celebrate your success, my dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline said no more, but quietly suffered him to lead her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly not such a home as one would picture as the abode of the
      queen of the night; for White, whose circumstances had never been
      affluent, had been brought lower than ever of late through the demands
      made upon him by Madeline, whom it had been necessary to fit out superbly
      before she could be presented to the gaze of the world. Still, poor as
      they were, the rooms were dear to Madeline, and as she entered them she
      felt stealing over her a sense of security and peace which she had not
      experienced all that evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good news had sped quickly, and the welcome given to the young actress
      was in keeping with all the rest. The table was spread for supper, the
      solitary bottle of champagne stood at the head, and poor Madame de Berny,
      now very worn and much aged, stood upon the narrow, dimly lighted stairs,
      with outstretched hands and quivering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear,&rsquo; she said, as she drew Madeline into the bedroom, and
      assisted her to remove her hat and cloak, &lsquo;to think that only a few years
      ago you stood at my poor dear Marie&rsquo;s knee, and listened, with open eyes
      and mouth, to the stories she used to tell about the theatre. Now, you are
      a leading lady, and she&mdash;oh! my poor girl!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Madame,&rsquo; said Madeline gently. &lsquo;I think Marie is happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Miss Madeline, how can I help grieving when I think of all my child
      has lost? To think that when she was rising so rapidly she could throw
      herself away upon a man who only betrayed her; that she should cause her
      father to die of a broken heart, and bring me to this!&rsquo; As Madeline
      listened she sank into a chair, and let her weary head rest upon her
      hands. Her face was paler than it had been before, and Madame de Berny
      looking at her saw that a look of terrible sadness, which she had often
      noticed before, was creeping again into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, my dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;<i>you</i> at least ought to be happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised her head and smiled, and the smile was even more pitiful
      to behold than the look of sadness had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you are right, Madame de Berny,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I ought to be happy, so
      I will try to be from this night forth;&rsquo; and as if to avoid further
      conversation she passed out into the sitting-room, where she found White
      awaiting her with a look of contented happiness in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puzzled and thoughtful, the old lady saw her go. What was the matter with
      the girl? She could not tell. Some few months before that day, when, in
      answer to an appeal from her, White had offered her a home, with himself
      and ward, she had come full of her own troubles, expecting to find a
      bright-eyed vivacious beautiful girl to soothe and cheer her. But instead
      of being the comforted she became the comforter. The first sight of the
      girl rent her heartstrings. Could this be Madeline Hazelmere? Could this
      be the lissome blue-eyed child, who had been the very impersonation of
      happy impulse and joy? This woman with the pale cheeks and strange, sad
      eyes? Madame de Berny paused before her shattered vision, gave one
      prolonged look, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not cry, dear Madame,&rsquo; Madeline had said, kindly taking her old friend
      affectionately in her arms; &lsquo;the poor chevalier has gone from a world in
      which it is more terrible to live than to leave. I hope he has no memory
      of it&mdash;that at least he is at peace.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange words, to come from a girl scarcely twenty years of age. They
      affected the Frenchwoman curiously at the time, and set her pondering
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer she remained with White the more she became impressed with the
      painful change that had taken place in Madeline. It was not that the child
      had become a woman, and had learnt to subdue her spirits to a sadder, more
      womanly tone; her soul was haunted by a memory which poisoned every
      pleasure which was lifted to her lips, and converted the world into a
      tomb. What the memory was, Madame could not understand, but she knew,
      whenever the girl&rsquo;s prospects seemed brightest, it haunted her the most,
      and that on that night when she had shone forth upon the world, and made
      hundreds envy her, it seemed to loom before her eyes more terribly than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days after that night when she had achieved her great
      theatrical triumph, Madeline was too much occupied with business to give
      much thought to herself. She seemed to be lifted on a whirlwind, and
      carried along in tumult&mdash;forgetting the past, thinking nothing of the
      future, and scarcely conscious even of the bewildering present.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third morning, however, a note arrived which dispelled the dream
      that enveloped her, and brought her to herself again. The note had been
      placed among many others upon the breakfast table. She looked twice or
      thrice at the handwriting, then opened the envelope, and read as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My dear Ophelia,&mdash;For the last few days I have been looking every
      hour, nay, every minute, for a visit from you. Am I to be again honoured
      by a visit from you in my studio, or may I take the liberty of waiting
      upon you? I have been putting one or two finishing touches to my work, but
      without the presence of the original I cannot bring it to completion. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Accept my friendly homage, which must be to you like a drop of water to
      the ocean.

    <p>
      <i>Blanco Serena.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having perused the note, Madeline laid it down again upon the table and
      looked round the room. How poverty-stricken it looked; how opposed to
      everything in the house of the successful painter who wrote that letter!
      She turned to White, who sat near her with his head buried in the folds of
      the &lsquo;Times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serena thinks that success has turned my head,&rsquo; she said quietly. &lsquo;I
      must undeceive him by giving him my last sitting for &ldquo;Ophelia&rdquo; to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, as soon as the breakfast was over, White retired to his
      studio, and Madeline went on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the house of Mr. Blanco Serena, she was made to feel her
      new greatness more than ever she had done before. The servant in livery
      looked at her with unusual respect, as he led her solemnly through long
      corridors to the studio, and ushered her into the presence of the great
      man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blanco Serena sat among his pictures. He wore an Eastern
      dressing-gown, and smoked a fantastically twisted meerschaum pipe. His
      eyes were fixed with rapt attention on the walls where his own handiwork
      was displayed; but when Madeline came in, he withdrew his gaze, collected
      his thoughts, and gave her a kindly welcome. To all his congratulations
      Madeline listened quietly, then she took her place before the painter,
      and, as he painted, her thoughts wandered to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, those eyes, those eyes,&rsquo; thought Serena to himself as he painted
      rapidly. &lsquo;I cannot put them on canvas. The critics will rave about my
      &ldquo;Ophelia,&rdquo; but their praise will never satisfy me. If I could only paint
      the expression of that face I should think myself the genius they call me,
      not the poor impostor I know myself to be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he tried and tried again, while Madeline sat patiently.
      Presently the studio door was opened, and with much ceremony, but no
      announcement, a stranger was shown in.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;A WALK ACROSS HYDE PARK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he new-comer was a
      tall, robust-looking man in the prime of life, who was dressed with the
      utmost neatness and exactness, in the plain frock coat and grey-coloured
      trousers so much in favour among so-called business men Despite the
      ceremony with which he was introduced, and which showed that he was an
      individual of no small importance, his manner was modest and retiring in
      the extreme, and he looked around him on the splendid temple of modern
      painting, and at its famous owner, with smiling and good-humoured homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena put down his brush at once, and warmly shook hands. Then, seeing
      Madeline, the new-comer made a movement as if to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I interrupt you,&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could say more, Madeline came forward gently, and offered
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Hazelmere!&rsquo; he exclaimed, recognising her; &lsquo;or shall I rather call
      you by the name you&rsquo;ve already made so famous?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know each other?&rsquo; interrupted Serena, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; cried Madeline, smiling. &lsquo;Mr. Forster and I are old, old
      friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this statement even the new-comer himself evinced some surprise; but
      Madeline continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was only a very little girl, Mr. Forster, I remember how you came
      to see my guardian one day when he was sick, and how, when you went away,
      he cried and told me how good you were. You came often after that, and we
      used to talk of you together. And the other night at the theatre, when I
      saw your face in the box, I felt so glad, and I said to myself, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      be afraid now, for there are at least two kind faces in front&mdash;one my
      dear guardian&rsquo;s, the other the face of the best friend he ever had in the
      world.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this simple praise Forster looked a little uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is White?&rsquo; he inquired nervously, as if for want of something better
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not immediately reply, so Serena answered for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the present moment, my dear Forster, our friend White is the happiest
      fellow in all the world, or shall I rather say, in all Bohemia. A hundred
      successful original plays, a thousand successful adaptations, could not
      have given him half the pleasure that he feels at the triumph of his
      charming ward. And well may he be proud. He has hatched at his lonely
      hearth a phoenix, who rises out of the ashes of our drama, to glorify the
      stage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but you spoil me,&rsquo; said Madeline, well pleased, nevertheless. &lsquo;It is
      so easy to act; and, besides, who but my dear guardian has taught me the
      little I know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you it is easy,&rsquo; returned Serena, gallantly; &lsquo;ah yes&mdash;and it is
      easy for a flower to look beautiful or for a lark to sing a splendid song.
      That is all the difference between genius and talent. All you have to do
      is to be natural, to be your charming self, and the art comes of itself,
      like the perfume from a rose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked at Forster and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serena would not say that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if he knew what a goose I was
      when I first began. It was in that little theatre at Ryde, in the Isle of
      Wight, and when I went on the people could not hear a word, and I did not
      know what to do with my hands and feet. The manager said I was the
      greatest idiot who ever stept upon his stage, and he was right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena was not to be dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another proof of genius,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Mere talent would have caught all
      the tricks of the stage, and by means of its affectations and
      insincerities gained cheap applause at the outset. I have often heard my
      friend Eugene Aram say that when he began he was so great a stick that no
      manager would keep him in his theatre. The people laughed at his legs,
      mimicked his voice. Critics compared him to the Knight of the Rueful
      Visage. He was invertebrate, inchoate, inarticulate. Look at him now. The
      people adore his legs and consider his voice music itself. That&rsquo;s genius,
      my dear, depend upon it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One touch of genius makes amends for much,&rsquo; observed Forster quietly. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think Aram is a good actor even now, but he is interesting and
      intelligent, and his eccentricities have a fascination.&rsquo; He added, turning
      to the picture in the easel, &lsquo;May I ask, is that picture a commission?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could afford it,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I should say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and make a
      present of it&mdash;to the original. But it&rsquo;s not worthy of her; upon my
      word it&rsquo;s not worthy. I&rsquo;m ashamed of my art when I compare my miserable
      attempt to the reality.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very like,&rsquo; said Forster thoughtfully, studying before the canvas;
      &lsquo;but too sorrowful; too sorrowful! I should not like to see Miss Hazelmere
      look like that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Ophelia,&rdquo;&rsquo; observed Serena apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather you had painted her as smiling and happy. So young a face
      should not reveal such depths of suffering. There is no hope here, and in
      Miss Hazelmere&rsquo;s face all should be hope and happiness.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to glance at Madeline, he was startled and surprised. She was
      gazing now at the picture with the very expression depicted in it; all
      life, all pleasure seemed to have faded out of her face, leaving nothing
      but blankness there, and the shadow of a painful dream. Her thoughts
      seemed to have wandered far away, and have left her unconscious of the
      presence in which she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he gazed the look faded, and the light came back to her eyes.
      Meeting his gaze she smiled, and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go now,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;my sitting is over, and I am already past my
      time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you ride or walk?&rsquo; asked Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to walk across the park, and then, at the Marble Arch, I shall
      take a cab.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I offer myself as an escort?&rsquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
      &lsquo;I am going that way, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, smiling benignly and blushing boyishly, but Madeline at once
      put her hand upon his arm and accepted his escort with a happy smile.
      Serena saw them to the door, and watched them as they walked chatting up
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I know the signs,&rsquo; muttered the painter to himself, &lsquo;and if
      Forster is not fascinated, Eros Athanatos is no true god. Well, so be it.
      It will be none the worse for my pictures, and a splendid thing for the
      girl.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with Madeline, Forster felt constrained and a little uneasy,
      but her perfect simplicity and frankness soon put him entirely at his
      ease. She was indeed happy beyond measure in his accidental companionship.
      Since her early childhood his name had been familiar to her as that of one
      whom White emphatically pronounced to be &lsquo;the best man he had ever known
      or hoped to know,&rsquo; and his perfect gentleness and kindliness, which
      impressed even the most casual observer of his countenance, won the
      open-hearted girl at once. Leaning lightly on his arm, she chatted away
      frankly and fearlessly, as she might have done to White himself. Frank
      without boldness, fearless without forwardness, in every word and gesture
      free and <i>spirituelle</i> without affectation, she fairly won her way to
      his heart of hearts. Talking with her was like talking with a child; she
      was so unconscious of herself, so un reserved; and this, seeing her
      wonderful physical beauty, constituted at once her peril and her charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing in at Albert Gate, they crossed Rotten Row, and strolled quietly
      across the park. It was a bright golden day, and Madeline, always the
      creature of physical and external impressions, seemed to kindle into new
      gladness. She looked at the fair horsewomen, of whom there was a fair
      sprinkling already, though it was early in the afternoon, and laughed for
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you like riding?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;I have never ridden; but I think if I
      were on a horse&rsquo;s back, I could ride&mdash;and ride&mdash;and ride&mdash;and
      never stop.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would find it duller than you think,&rsquo; said Forster. &lsquo;I ride here
      often, and do not think it very amusing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment Madeline asked, quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Mrs. Forster ride?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Forster?&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean your wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife,&rsquo; he echoed, in still greater astonishment. &lsquo;I am not married!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How strange!&rsquo; exclaimed Madeline, with raised eyebrows. &lsquo;Not married?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is it so strange?&rsquo; asked Forster, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not look like an old bachelor&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t mean that; but
      there is something in your manner which makes one think of a kind wife,
      and little children, and home. You are not old, and yet I feel as if I
      could speak to you so freely, and could tell you anything, as I do my dear
      guardian. Do you understand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I do&mdash;partly,&rsquo; answered Forster, not without a certain
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that lady whom I saw you with at the theatre on the first night of
      &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;&mdash;I thought <i>she</i> was Mrs. Forster.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was my sister.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on for a little in silence. Forster was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is curious, after all, that you should class me among the married
      people, for the fact is, I am a widower. My poor wife died many years ago,
      and left me one child, a boy. My sister keeps my house; but when you talk
      of home, and home ties, I cannot help telling you that I am a very lonely
      man&mdash;quite an old bachelor, indeed, in my way. When, after a long day
      in the City, I return to my house, and get among my books and pictures, I
      am still lonely, but sometimes very happy after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl less naïve and unsuspicious than Madeline might have been
      astonished at this fragment of autobiography, coming from such a man, and
      might have questioned her own fascinations as to the origin of such
      candour. But Madeline thought it quite natural, as between friend and
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But let us speak of other things,* continued Forster, after a pause, &lsquo;of
      yourself. I sometimes think, if you will forgive me for saying so, that
      you must be rather lonely too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she replied readily; adding with her brightest smile, &lsquo;not while I
      have Mr. White.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, he is a good fellow&mdash;but you have neither father nor mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They died long ago. I do not remember them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your other relations?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have none.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When my father died I was left with poor people, who brought me up. Then
      trouble came, and Uncle Mark died, and I was brought to Mr. White. Uncle
      Luke brought me. After he went away he used to write me, but at last all
      letters ceased. Mr. White made inquiries, but he had disappeared, and no
      one knew where he had gone. Dear Uncle Luke!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was broken, and her eyes were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What made you think of going upon the stage?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to go to the theatre with Mademoiselle de Berny, and she used to
      make me hear her go through her parts. I always loved acting, Mr. Forster,
      and at Mr. White&rsquo;s there were so many professional people. Afterwards,
      when I was older, I tried to think how I could repay my dear guardian for
      all his kindness, and then I thought if I could act&mdash;only a little&mdash;it
      would be some help. When he first heard me recite he was pleased, and I
      told him I would like to become an actress and act in <i>his</i> plays. So
      he sent me down into the country to try. That was how it began.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you like acting?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better than anything in the world; best of all, Mr. Forster, because it
      makes my dear guardian happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will make a great name/
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that&mdash;yes, I do care; for a great name would mean a
      great deal of money, and I want <i>that?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! Why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because Mr. White is poor, and I want to make him rich&mdash;as rich as
      he deserves to be, for all his goodness to me. I love him so much. I
      should like to put him in a palace and surround him with splendour, like a
      king in a fairy tale.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think White would care for a palace, and he&rsquo;s too Bohemian for a
      king.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by Bohemian?&rsquo; asked Madeline, with her characteristic
      frankness. &lsquo;I often hear the word, and I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do either,&rsquo; he answered at once, &lsquo;unless it means
      unconventionality, carelessness of appearances, contempt for Mrs. Grundy.
      In White&rsquo;s case, though, it means far more&mdash;honesty, lightness of
      heart, patience under disappointment, all combined in one of the best
      fellows in the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you knew all about him, Mr. Forster, you would say even more than
      that. If you knew&mdash;if you knew&mdash;but no one will ever know but
      God! Oh, I should die if he even thought me ungrateful&mdash;he is so
      good. I have no other friend in all the world!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not cry; you have one other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While I live, I hope you will not doubt it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and, looking at him through her tears, held out both her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so kind of you to say so,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Yes, you are good also; but
      no one in the world can be to me what Mr. White has been.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is right that you should be grateful,&rsquo; said Forster, gently, &lsquo;and I
      think more highly of you for that holy feeling. But here we are at the
      Marble Arch. Must I call a cab?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, unless you will drive home with me, and see Mr. White. I
      know he is at home, for he is very busy on his new play.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and Forster&rsquo;s face shone
      with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall it be a hansom or a four-wheeler?&rsquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hansom, please; I cannot bear these slow old things, and I love
      hansoms. I used to think when I was a little girl that I would like to
      have one all to myself, and drive about in it for ever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hansom was called, and the pair entered it; they drove swiftly away to
      St. John&rsquo;s Wood. Very little more was said on either side, but Forster
      felt very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned into the old familiar street, and reined up before the old
      familiar &lsquo;studio,&rsquo; which Madeline knew and loved so well. They found the
      dramatist <i>en déshabille</i> and very busy, not on the new play, as
      Madeline had stated, but on a picture&mdash;which, on their entry, he
      hastily covered up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Forster,&rsquo; he exclaimed, with real delight. &lsquo;How glad I am! But,
      upon my life, you puzzle me. How does it happen that&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked questioningly at Madeline, who laughed and explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I met Mr. Forster when I was sitting for my portrait, and he brought me
      home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good of him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it not? But what are you doing? Painting something! You told me the
      other day that you did not intend to paint any more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; returned the dramatist, &lsquo;nothing at all. Only a kind of
      sketch&mdash;a little thing of memory. No, no,&rsquo; he added, as Madeline
      approached the canvas, &lsquo;you mustn&rsquo;t look at it. It&rsquo;s a secret. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a&mdash;portrait&mdash;of&mdash;a&mdash;young&mdash;lady&mdash;I&mdash;admire.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly laughing, he endeavoured to prevent Madeline from inspecting the
      picture, but she was too quick for him, and had already uncovered the
      easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s <i>me!</i>&rsquo; she cried, and continued merrily, with a theatrical
      gesture, &lsquo;I mean &ldquo;it is I&rdquo;!&mdash;which is the same thing, and more
      grammatical.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grammar was never your strong point, my dear,&rsquo; observed White, gently.
      &lsquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Madeline indeed, but Madeline the child, as she first appeared,
      with wild, wistful eyes, in that lonely studio. The colours were crude,
      the drawing incorrect, but for all that the expression was there, and the
      whole thing was instinct with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With smiling face and clasped hands, Madeline stood gazing at the
      likeness; then, as if moved by a sudden impulse, she threw her arms round
      White&rsquo;s neck and kissed him, first on one cheek then on the other, while
      Forster looked on in amused sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You like it, my dear? It was&mdash;ahem!&mdash;a sort of a kind of an
      inspiration. It came upon me when I was looking at the play, and, by Jove,
      I had to do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is really capital,&rsquo; said Forster. &lsquo;I should have recognised the
      likeness anywhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s only a daub,&rsquo; returned White, humbly. &lsquo;I might have
      painted decently if I had stuck to it, instead of dangling after Jew
      managers and doing potboilers for Eugene Aram. But you&rsquo;re fresh from
      seeing Serena&rsquo;s picture, and that gives my thing no chance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for Mr. Serena&rsquo;s picture,&rsquo; cried Madeline. &lsquo;I do not like to
      tell him so, but I am sure I am not so lovely as he makes me, and I know
      my eyes are not <i>green</i>. I like your picture ever so much the best&mdash;and,
      oh! it was so kind of you to do it, Mr. White. It is just like me as I was&mdash;a
      nasty, little, pale thing, with shock hair!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she stood contemplating the likeness in an ecstasy of honest
      reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, you were never nasty,&rsquo; said White, good humouredly. &lsquo;Shock
      haired, if you like, but charming as you are now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always charming, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; suggested Forster, mildly &lsquo;Do you know, I
      should like to buy this picture?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take it, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s of no pecuniary value. Stop, though! I can
      make a composition of it by putting in some flowers and a bit of
      background, and calling it &ldquo;Primroses&mdash;a Study,&rdquo; or something of that
      sort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll allow <i>me</i> to fix the price?&rsquo; said Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there Madeline interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Mr. White, you must not sell it; that is, you will sell it to no one
      but the original. How much must I give you for it? A thousand guineas? Two
      thousand? Tell me, and I&rsquo;ll begin to save at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused with sparkling eyes, looking into her guardian&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Hazelmere is right,&rsquo; said Forster; &lsquo;she must keep the sketch as a
      souvenir of her childhood. No other person in the world has a right to
      possess it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said on the subject, and White soon led the way into the
      adjoining house, there to dispense the hospitalities to his friend, who,
      however, soon took his leave, and departed by omnibus towards his home in
      South Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night afterwards, however, Madeline saw his hearty face looking from a
      box in the theatre, and between the acts he came round to speak to her. He
      said little, but what he did say set her wits working, and the next
      morning she told White, as they sat at breakfast, that Mr. Forster had
      witnessed the performance on the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, indeed,&rsquo; said the dramatist with a pleased smile. &lsquo;Did he come
      round?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for a few minutes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s rather odd, and I think you may take it as a compliment. Forster
      doesn&rsquo;t care for the drama as a rule.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact, my dear. Why, though we&rsquo;re such capital friends, he has seldom come
      even to see <i>my</i> plays.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know his sister?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you he had a sister?&rsquo; asked White, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed. Well, the fact is, I don&rsquo;t know her. She&rsquo;s a sort of amiable
      Ogre; pious, you know, and all that sort of thing. Whenever I have dined
      at the house, she has been invisible; but we&rsquo;ve generally met at his
      club.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his little boy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? Who told you he had a little boy? The same informant. Why, he&rsquo;s been
      giving you his autobiography!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He only told me he was a widower.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s more than he ever told to me, though of course I was aware of
      it. You see, our friendship has been a sort of club friendship, and,
      besides, all the favour has been on his side. A rich man like Forster and
      a poor devil like myself can&rsquo;t meet on equal terms.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is rich, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very. One of the oldest firms in the city. His house in Cromwell Road is
      like a palace, and the pictures in it alone would realise a fortune.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline looked thoughtful, then she said&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s so rich.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless me! why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like rich people, and&mdash;and he&rsquo;s so nice!&rsquo; &lsquo;If you were a
      poor poet, or a struggling painter, or a musician with a craze, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t blame the dear fellow for his good fortune. He&rsquo;s so generous, so
      good-hearted&mdash;not only to me, but to every fellow-creature who needs
      his help. Then look how modest and unaffected he is. His own flunkeys are
      lords to him, and when he asks for a cup in his own house he&rsquo;s like a
      humble City clerk asking deferentially for refreshment in a large hotel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus begun, White did not pause till he had sounded the praises of
      his patron over and over again; told of his goodness and generosity to
      himself personally; of his countless good deeds to others, who would
      otherwise have sunk long ago in the dark waters of Bohemia. The theme
      brought honest tears, as White concluded that &lsquo;if ever there was an angel
      in a frock-coat and grey trousers, it was James Forster.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsuspicious as Madeline herself, White at first saw nothing remarkable in
      the close interest with which Forster followed the fortunes of his ward.
      Nor, when some days afterwards the merchant again put in an appearance,
      bringing with him a bouquet of choice flowers, did the simple soul awake
      to much suspicion of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, however, as White sat at work on the scenario of a new
      play, which he was about to submit to the distinguished Mr. Aram, Madeline
      entered in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you busy? May I speak to you?&rsquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear; my time is yours. But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something terrible has happened.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatist pushed his papers aside, and arose trembling to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Forster&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not ill, I hope?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no. But I have just left him. He was at Mr. Serena&rsquo;s, and he came
      part of the way home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Pray go on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I was afraid of it!&rsquo; cried Madeline, with a sob. &lsquo;I should have
      avoided him!&mdash;and yet, at first, I could not believe it possible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do explain!&rsquo; cried White, in hopeless perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline sank into a chair, crying, and hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has asked me to become his wife.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;BLANCO SERENA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Blanco Serena,
      the prophet of a new school of painting, the object of which was more
      closely to reconcile and blend the kindred arts of painting, poetry, and
      music, occupied a large detached house in South Kensington, whither his
      worshippers flocked every Sunday, as to the shrine of some patron saint.
      The walls were embellished with designs from his own pencil, or those of
      his own friends; the furniture was his own invention, in form as well as
      colour; the ceilings were cerulean, like the heavens, and like the heavens
      were studded with golden stars; so that when the rapt creature looked up
      in contemplation or in inspiration, his vision was rewarded by celestial
      glimpses. There were no carpets on the floors, but here and there costly
      rugs were strewn. The house formed a quadrangle, in the centre of which
      was an open court with a playing fountain, and by the fountain, in fine
      weather, the prophet and the faithful would lie upon tiger and lion skins,
      smoking pipes and calumets of strange device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena himself was a middle-aged man, with a high, bald forehead, long
      apostolic beard, and large brown dreamy eyes. He was a good soul, with the
      kindest disposition, and the affectations of his profession did not extend
      to his personal character. The fault lay more in his stars than himself
      that he had become an eccentric painter. He began merrily, in Bohemian
      fashion, with a clay pipe in his mouth, painting real landscapes from
      nature and human beings from the life, and producing compositions
      noteworthy for fine colour and honest effect. But he discovered early, as
      many another prophet has discovered, that it did not pay. In an angry
      moment, one day, disgusted with a picture which he had just completed, he
      took up his brush and deliberately reversed all the colours of his
      composition. Where water was blue, he made it vermilion; where boughs were
      green and golden, he made them purple and cerulean; a white human figure
      standing by water became an Ethiop, through excess of shadow; and finally,
      out of sheer devilry, he covered the daffodil sky with layers of pea-green
      cloud. He had just completed his work, and was scowling at it grimly, when
      there entered Ponto, the new art critic from Camford. No sooner did Ponto
      see the mutilated picture than he clasped his hands and raised his eyes
      rapturously to heaven. &lsquo;At last!&rsquo; he cried, and wrung Serena by the hand.
      &lsquo;Only paint like this, and your fame is sure.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Megatherium&rsquo; of the
      following Saturday contained an article by Ponto, entitled, &lsquo;Mr. Blanco
      Serena&rsquo;s new painting&mdash;a Reverie in Vermilion and Pea-green,&rsquo; in
      which article it was clearly demonstrated, not merely that the painting
      was one of the masterpieces of the world, but that the painter was the
      first &lsquo;modern man&rsquo; who had dared &lsquo;to give prominence on canvas to
      evanescent cosmic moods.&rsquo; From that day forth the epithets cosmic, august,
      titanic, supersensuous, sublime, and other adjectives of equal meaning
      were the especial property of Serena and his imitators; for that imitators
      came soon goes perhaps without saying, seeing that imitation is so easy.
      &lsquo;Reveries&rsquo; on canvas became the rage; to be non-natural was the fashion.
      Artists who had once in their innocence strained every nerve to study
      great models and to copy nature, now tortured ingenuity to represent
      &lsquo;evanescent cosmic moods&rsquo;&mdash;out of colour, out of drawing, and out of
      all harmony with anything but the diseased invention of bad painters and
      the bad critics who urged them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena, as we have said, was a good fellow, and took his success sensibly.
      Only to one man in the world did he secretly confess the facts of the
      case. &lsquo;I know I am a humbug,&rsquo; he said to Forster, &lsquo;and that those who
      praise me are humbugs. I know that I paint worse than I did at twenty, and
      that, when I die, and my school dies with me, posterity will find me out.
      This is why, now and then, I follow the true lights of my soul, and paint
      a true picture; just to keep my work from utterly perishing in Limbo, just
      to enable some poor soul in the far future to say, &ldquo;After all, Blanco
      Serena might, had he chosen, have escaped from being the æsthetic Prig of
      his period.&rdquo; But what I am the scribblers and the public have made me. If
      another man painted a bony woman in yellow gauze, with red hair and pale
      green eyes, and impossible arms and legs, he would be found out directly:
      but only let me paint such a figure, and call it &ldquo;Persephone musing by the
      waters of Lethe,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Memory kneeling by the grave of Hope,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fading
      away: a Sonata in Sunset tints,&rdquo; and I am sure at least of Ponto&rsquo;s praise
      and the public approval. Well, of all humbugs Art humbug is the worst,
      though, after all, worse saints have been canonised than Blanco Serena.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the studio of Serena, a few days after Madeline&rsquo;s visit, came Ponto,
      the art critic, bringing with him a thin, middle-aged. Frenchman, with a
      coarse mouth and a sinister expression of countenance. The painter, with
      deft and careless hand, was adding a few touches to the picture of
      Ophelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serena,&rsquo; cried Ponto, &lsquo;let me introduce you to M. Auguste de Gavrolles,
      from Paris&mdash;the friend and pupil of the supreme and impeccable
      Gautier. He is a poet, an ardent worshipper of your genius, and in all
      matters of art completely sane a cosmic.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena smiled and held out his hand, which the Frenchman took rapturously,
      and raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Monsieur,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;this is the proudest moment of my life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponto threw himself into a chair, and looked around him with a smile of
      feline insipidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you have there, my dear Serena?&rsquo; he asked, blinking at the
      picture. &lsquo;Ah, I see, another superbly musical meditation in the minor key
      of flake white!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a portrait,&rsquo; said Serena, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An ideal portrait&mdash;quite so. How wonderfully in that floating
      drapery you have conveyed the serene insouciance of trances of languor
      crescending into aberration of supersensual dream!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is neither more nor less than a careful likeness of the original,&rsquo;
      returned Serena, modestly. &lsquo;In the arrangement of the colours I wish to
      convey&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spirituality of a superb and life-consuming dream, fired with the
      arid flame of incipient passion&mdash;ethereal, almost epicene&mdash;conscious
      of throbbing vistas of asexual retrospection and chromatic wastes of
      fruitless future fantasy, interspersed with forlorn gulfs of irremediable
      darkness and despair. Added to this, and seen in the pose of the limp hand
      and the melancholy texture of the flesh tints, is the Lethean
      consciousness of a drowned and devastated ideal, unlightened by one star
      of promise and irredeemed by one flower of celestial ruth. Am I right? Do
      I take your meaning?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said Serena, dryly, and turned to look at the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, with shoulders elevated, and <i>pince-nez</i> in position, was
      gazing eagerly at the portrait. He now turned with a bow to Serena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A portrait, did you say, Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask of whom?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the new actress, Miss Diana Vere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is curious,&rsquo; said Gavrolles; &lsquo;but pardon, the face seems familiar to
      me. I have seen it somewhere before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! Well, such a face, once seen, is not likely to be forgotten.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not beautiful!&rsquo; cried the Frenchman, with elevated shoulders and
      extended hands; &lsquo;and seen upon your canvas, how sublime! How shall I
      express to you&mdash;to you, great artist, great genius, what at this
      moment I feel? But tell me, Monsieur, this&mdash;is she a friend of yours?
      No? Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      41 know her slightly, that is all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would I not give to see her, to have the honour of her
      acquaintance!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you wish to see her,&rsquo; said Serena, &lsquo;you have only to go to the
      Parthenon Theatre, where she appears nightly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go; but stay, I return this night to Paris&mdash;but I shall
      return, and then, perhaps, you will introduce me?&rsquo; Serena shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;The lady sees no one, and is quite a
      recluse. What is still more peculiar is the fact that she has a particular
      aversion to gentlemen of your nation&mdash;to France and to Frenchmen
      without exception.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You amaze me, Monsieur! Ah, this insular prejudice, how bête! But perhaps
      she has reason&mdash;perhaps she has lived in my country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; returned Serena, as if tired of the subject; and he commenced
      again to work at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponto looked over his shoulder as he worked with admiring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must know Gavrolles better,&rsquo; he observed; &lsquo;I like him; we all like
      him. He is a man of ideas.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles placed his hand upon his heart and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have learned of my master, the immortal Théophile, to worship what is
      beautiful, to adore what is superb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In France, at the present moment,&rsquo; continued Ponto, patronisingly,
      &lsquo;Gavrolles represents the school of supersensuous personal yearning. In
      his last book of poems, &ldquo;Parfums de la Chair,&rdquo; and particularly in that
      superb fragment, &ldquo;Cameo Satanique,&rdquo; he has supplied the connecting link
      between the celestial appetite of Gautier and the divine nausea of
      Baudelaire. Till Gavrolles came, the calendar of imperial passion was
      incomplete. What Smith, Jones, and Keats are to our august poetry, that is
      he to the poetry of modern France.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Monsieur, forbear!&rsquo; cried the Frenchman. &lsquo;You overwhelm me with
      shame. Such praise&mdash;before the master!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go further,&rsquo; cried Ponto, recklessly, &lsquo;and I will fearlessly
      assert, that in the golden roll of the fearless and fecund Parisian
      Parnassus, there is no more affluent name than that of my friend
      Gavrolles. His &ldquo;Chant Aromatique&rdquo; to the Venus of Dahomey would alone
      entitle him to a place in that Pantheon where the names of Victor Hugo and
      Achille de Ganville shine effulgent, while his masterly management of the
      Sestina, in his great address to myself, is only to be compared with the
      Titanic sculpture cf Michael Angelo, or the colossal imagery of Potts.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena smiled gloomily. He was familiar with that sort of praise, as
      addressed to himself, but, with all his cynicism, he scarcely approved of
      its lavish application to an obscure Frenchman. The fact was, that the
      whole speech formed part and parcel of an eulogistic article, in Ponto&rsquo;s
      best manner, then in type for the &lsquo;Megatherium,&rsquo; a widely circulated
      literary journal in which nepotism and malignity formed equal parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; observed Serena, still quietly at work, &lsquo;I see that
      MacAlpine has been falling foul of our friend Potts in the &ldquo;North
      British.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      MacAlpine was a cantankerous critic, hailing from beyond the Border, and
      with a Highland disregard of consequences in the expression of his
      literary opinions. Ponto turned livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MacAlpine,&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;bears to the immortal Potts the relation that a
      leper does to Paian Apollo. It is well known that MacAlpine has been
      guilty of murder, bigamy, rapine, incest, and larceny, but all these are
      nothing compared to his fiendish and futile statement that Potts is not
      the most stupendous, wonderful, awe-inspiring, celestial, and cosmic
      creature existing on this planet. Mac Alpine, it is notorious, left his
      grandmother to starve in the workhouse, and kicked his little brother to
      death, but these crimes are venial by the side of his hateful and hellish
      assertion that your divine and spirit-compelling picture of &ldquo;Psyche
      watching the Sleep of Eros&rdquo; is out of proportion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena sighed, then smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, my dear Ponto, I sometimes think that a little hostile
      criticism is refreshing. I really find it so, when it comes in my way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponto shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The only true attitude of criticism is that of worship,&rsquo; he exclaimed.
      &lsquo;The man who, in contemplating your consummate masterpiece, could be
      conscious of any feeling save of the surging forces of cosmic yearning,
      flowering into the form of perfect idealisation, and shining with the
      reflected light of coruscating eternities of sterile pain&mdash;such a
      man, I say, is capable of any social crime, and incapable of any aesthetic
      perception.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; returned Serena. &lsquo;What you say is doubtless very flattering,
      but if criticism is pure worship, how do you account for your own attacks
      on the literary productions of the enemies of the aesthetic school?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All modern schools but one are execrable,&rsquo; returned Ponto, with a
      grinding of the teeth and a waving of the hand. &lsquo;It is enough for us to
      pronounce that they are not&mdash;Art! In approaching them we do not
      criticise&mdash;we simply obliterate; we crush, as we crush a reptile or
      an unclean thing. The man who denies absolute perfection to Potts, or
      universal mastery to Blanco Serena, at once proclaims, not merely his
      incompetence to speak on any artistic subject whatever, but by inference
      his moral degradation as a human being. We wave him from our vision&mdash;we
      wipe him out. He is a loathsome Philistine, an outcast, physically and
      intellectually abominable. Such a man once said, in my hearing, that
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Maupin&rdquo; was not the purest, wholesomest, most supremely
      sane and salutary book produced since the Divine Comedy, and that, on the
      whole, he preferred Wordsworth to Gautier as a moral teacher. My whole
      soul revolted. I shrank from that man with a shudder, and I am convinced
      that the wretch is ethically lost and intellectually paralytic.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman shook his head dolefully, as over some sad chronicle of
      human wickedness or sorrow. Serena laughed and turned with twinkling eyes
      to the excited critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confess between ourselves that &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Maupin&rdquo; is not virile.
      For my own part, I never read it without feeling as if I had been
      slobbered over by a dirty baby.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Serena,&rsquo; cried Ponto, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk like that. I know you
      don&rsquo;t mean it, but the very expression is worthy that infernal scoundrel
      MacAlpine. Not virile? Certainly not, and Heaven forbid! Virility, dear
      master, is coarseness, ugliness, rudeness, and hideousness. Is a rose-leaf
      virile? Are sweet shawms, exquisite scents, forlorn pulsations, and
      cadences of sexless and impotent desire, are these virile? The book of
      which we speak has been exquisitely called by a contemporary the Golden
      Book of spirit and sense; nay more, &ldquo;The Holy Writ of Beauty!&rdquo; In every
      page of it we feel the swooning consciousness, the stinging and slaying
      scourge, of fruitless and rootless passion, and the divine dew of
      incommunicable and luminous lust watering the spent fibres of a parched
      and palpitating aesthetic dream. We feel more! We feel that in realising
      this swoon of sensuous yet despairing pain, sharp as tears, bitter as
      brine, and sinuous as the serpent, and in falling back like a fountain to
      the ground from the heaven of eternally unsatisfied longing and delight,
      we penetrate to the central mystery of life, and see the white heart of
      the great rose of being pulsating with one melodious throb of
      self-satiating and non-virile bliss!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena yawned, for he had heard all this before, and he was not
      particularly interested. As for the Frenchman, he listened and applauded,
      with many shrugs and smiles, but there was a lurking expression in his
      cat-like eye which showed that he was not altogether blind to the
      absurdity of the fatuous Ponto.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not our intention further to place on record the lucubrations of
      this typical critic of the period. The reader is doubtless familiar with
      the kind of criticism of which he and such as he are the mouthpieces. It
      has, perhaps, one redeeming merit&mdash;that of earnestness and
      thoroughness&mdash;and even its characteristic nepotism should not blind
      us to the fact that it reveals the existence of a real aspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arm-in-arm, Ponto and Gavrolles presently sallied forth, leaving Serena to
      enjoy his quiet meerschaum alone. As they went, the Frenchman was loud in
      praise of the painter, of his mighty genius and unassuming ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this &ldquo;Ophelia&rdquo; whom he has painted,&rsquo; he cried presently, &lsquo;is she so
      fair as that?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponto confessed that he seldom went to the theatre, and he had not seen
      the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I am interested much,&rsquo; cried the other. &lsquo;I must see her, I must know
      her, when I return to London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They hailed a hansom and got into it together. As they drove along the
      crowded streets in eager conversation, a young man, passing along on foot,
      glanced at their faces, started, and gazed eagerly at Gavrolles. The gaze
      only occupied a moment, then the vehicle was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was Edgar Sutherland, strolling along to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That face!&rsquo; he muttered to himself, standing and looking after the
      hansom. &lsquo;Where have I seen it before? Is it possible? Good heavens, now I
      remember! Can it be indeed the same?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in thought, with set lips and knitted brow, he walked on to his
      destination.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;AT THE CLUB.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ames Forster, of
      the great City firm of Forster and Forster, found himself at the early age
      of thirty-five a rich and prosperous man, with plenty of leisure and a
      simple taste for imaginative literature and the fine arts. He was a
      widower, his wife having died ten years previously in the first year of
      their marriage, leaving him an only son; and his fine mansion in Cromwell
      Road, South Kensington, was presided over by his spinster sister Margaret,
      his elder by some five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cares of business sat lightly on this good man&rsquo;s shoulders, and he
      could at any moment have retired with a large independence; but early
      habits and inclination kept him to the office, long after his daily
      presence there was unnecessary, and he wished to remain there until his
      son was old enough to take his place. His office hours, however, were very
      short, and when they were over he assiduously cultivated the society of
      painters and men of letters. Many a struggling artist had cause to bless
      his liberality. The walls of his house were decorated with some of the
      finest paintings of the period; and he loved nothing better than to add to
      his collection by discovering genius, and paying liberally for its works,
      long before the trumpet of fame had given those works a price in the
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although himself a strict man of business, he loved Bohemian society and
      Bohemian ways, always holding good-humouredly that it was the prerogative
      of artists and authors to play pranks denied to plain men like himself.
      His admiration for genius was quite simple and boy-like. In certain
      departments of literature, particularly in that of early English poetry,
      he had an almost special knowledge, gained in the course of his
      acquisition of a fine old-fashioned library; and nothing delighted him
      more than to communicate informally to the &lsquo;Megatherium&rsquo; or to &lsquo;Notes and
      Queries&rsquo; occasional notes and correspondence on the pet subjects of his
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known White for years, and been his staunchest helper and
      benefactor. Poor White, the best and kindliest fellow in the world, had
      neither the art of making money nor the knack of keeping it when it came;
      so that he was generally neck deep in difficulties, and would have sunk
      often in the quagmire of bankruptcy had no helping hand been near. As a
      painter he was not a genius; yet Forster bought his pictures, very often
      commissioning and paying for them long before they had taken shape on the
      easel. So that the gentle Bohemian had been heard more than once to
      exclaim that, in the course of his long heavenward pilgrimage, he had
      encountered only one guardian angel, and that angel was James Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the interview described in a recent chapter, White and
      Forster sat alone dining at a quiet table in the Junior Athenæum Club, of
      which the merchant was a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad she has told you,&rsquo; said Forster quietly. &lsquo;Yes, I have asked her
      to become my wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White did not speak for some minutes, and his expression was very sad and
      scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; he murmured at last. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell how sorry I am. I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what to say, upon my soul. It is such an honour&mdash;such a
      surprise too&mdash;and you, God knows you are the best man in the world.
      But it can&rsquo;t be. You had it from her own lips. She will never marry.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears, and he gulped down a glass of wine in
      extreme emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he added eagerly, not meeting the other&rsquo;s eyes, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s only a
      poor girl, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be right for a man in your position to marry an
      actress.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never loved a woman before,&rsquo; returned the merchant, &lsquo;and I know I shall
      never love again. My first marriage was not altogether a happy one, and I
      was driven more than led into it; but, thank God, I did my duty, and I
      have my boy. But I&rsquo;m a lonely man&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know how lonely, and I
      thought&mdash;I thought this might have been.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to God it could, I do with all my soul.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure of that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And oh, my dear Forster,&rsquo; cried White, almost sobbing, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t fancy that
      my dear girl doesn&rsquo;t value you at your worth. She knows how good you are.
      She knows what a friend you have been to us all, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she does not love me. Well, I could hardly dare to expect it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that. I swear it&rsquo;s not that. As I&rsquo;m a living man I believe she
      worships the very ground you tread on. &ldquo;Dear Guardian,&rdquo; she said to me
      last night, &ldquo;I never was so happy and proud, and yet I never was so sad.
      Tell him how grateful I am, how gladly I would die to serve him&mdash;but
      as for marriage, you know it can never be.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that?&rsquo; asked Forster, looking keenly at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      White&rsquo;s face was pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do know it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will never marry?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I understand,&rsquo; said Forster, with a sigh of relief. &lsquo;She has made
      up her mind to devote herself to her noble profession, and she believes,
      perhaps wisely, that a great artist should be free of all domestic ties.
      But do you think I am one of those idiots, those miserable moneybags, who
      account the profession of an actress a degradation? She should never leave
      the stage, unless of her own wish and will. She should be encouraged,
      helped as far as a plain fellow like myself could help her&mdash;in all
      the aspirations of her art. I should glory in her success, and triumph in
      her triumph&mdash;I should indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White looked at the bright open face of Forster, and fairly wrung his
      hands in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish it were possible,&rsquo; he groaned. &lsquo;For her sake, even more than
      yours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster leant over the table, and continued in rapid, eager tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she loves another man, tell me, and I shall be satisfied. I don&rsquo;t want
      to know his name, but if he is poor let me make him rich. More than
      anything in the world, even more than my own happiness, I seek her
      welfare. I love her, White, and mine is not a selfish love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wrong, dear friend. She loves no one else. Poor child! She has
      never known what love is, and she never will know it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in White&rsquo;s manner at last awoke the other&rsquo;s suspicion and
      wonder. The face of the poor fellow was so utterly forlorn, his words and
      gestures so extraordinary, that Forster began to share his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is some mystery. Cannot I know it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Impossible. But you are
      right.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it concern Madeline herself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her friends and relations?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, tell me&mdash;that is, if it can be told.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White fell back in his chair, and let his hands drop heedlessly by his
      side, &lsquo;It cannot be told. My poor darling! It is something in her past
      life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There he paused in despair. But Forster, himself trembling violently,
      touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her past life? What is that to me? I know nothing of it, and I seek to
      know nothing. If there is any page in her life she wishes me not to read,
      let her close the book; I will never ask her to open it. I love her too
      absolutely not to be content with what she is, the sweetest and purest
      woman I have ever known.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think her pure? So she is, God knows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she is worthy to be a queen. I think I am not worthy to tie her
      shoe-strings. But this does not prevent me loving her; it only makes my
      love something like idolatry. Don&rsquo;t think that it is mere infatuation. I
      know my own mind well, and I shall never change.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More followed in the same strain, but Forster did not succeed in eliciting
      any further explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So White remained the very picture of misery, and, with his eyes full of
      tears, wrung the merchant&rsquo;s hand again and again, uttering wild
      professions of personal attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later they parted. White, with somewhat unsteady steps, for he
      had drunk liberally, made his way to his favourite club. Forster walked
      rapidly to Piccadilly, and, entering an omnibus, rode in sad reverie to
      South Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman in gorgeous livery admitted the plain man into his princely
      home; and along a lobby hung with choice pictures, up a staircase
      ornamented with some of the most perfect specimens of modern sculpture, he
      found his way to the drawing-room, where his sister Margaret was sitting
      in solitary state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Forster was fresh and wholesome-looking like her brother, but her
      forehead was lower, her lips thinner and tighter, her whole expression
      colder, harder, and more respectable, and she wore much more gorgeous
      apparel She adored her brother and his child, with the quiet adoration of
      a frosty and impeccable well-dressed virgin. In matters of religion she
      was very High Church, a staunch follower of the Rev. Father Seraphin, of
      the Kensington Oratory, and there was scarcely a day in the year on which
      she did not hear morning and evening mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are late, James,&rsquo; she said as he entered. &lsquo;I suppose you have dined?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, at the club. I have just time to dress for the theatre. Will you
      come and bring James? I have a box.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What theatre, James?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Parthenon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are they playing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cymbeline.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, James, you have seen that performance twice already to my
      knowledge,&rsquo; said Margaret, lifting her eyebrows. &lsquo;Is it so very good?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much so that I want you to see it again, and&mdash;and I want James to
      see it. The new actress is charming. But there is no time to lose, and the
      carriage will be at the door in half an hour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret rose, smiling, well pleased at the attention of her brother, and
      passed upstairs to prepare her little nephew. Left alone in the
      drawing-room, Forster paced up and down in a somewhat gloomy brown study,
      muttering again and again to himself, and pausing from time to time to
      gaze into one of the great mirrors; he was not, however, gazing at his own
      reflection, though he seemed to be doing so&mdash;he was contemplating a
      visionary figure far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the evening, Forster, with his sister and his son, occupied a
      box in the Parthenon. They arrived late, and when they entered &lsquo;Imogen&rsquo;
      was in the middle of her first parting with &lsquo;Posthumus,&rsquo; but as she left
      the stage she glanced up and met Forster&rsquo;s eyes. Margaret Forster saw that
      look, and in a moment her suspicions were awakened. For the rest of the
      evening she was busily engaged, not following the play, but jealously
      watching her brother. As she did so, her face hardened and her eyes grew
      cold as steel; for she had discovered his secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play ended, the curtain descended, and in answer to the enthusiastic
      applause of the audience Imogen came before the curtain. Then Margaret
      Forster saw the actress glance up again with a smile of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove home and supped together in the great dining-room. Forster was
      generally a water-drinker, but on this occasion he ordered champagne, and
      pressed his sister to partake of it with him. The wise virgin, who saw
      that something was coming, was not to be persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Forster dismissed the footman in waiting; then, looking to
      Margaret with a bright but somewhat nervous smile he asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, how did you like her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Vere? I think she is rather pretty and acts intelligently.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Intelligently! She is a genius. Do take some champagne.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret shook her head. She saw that her brother was excited, and
      determined to keep cool. To try him, she changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How pretty the Princess looked. I suppose the greyheaded gentleman with
      her was her father, the King of Denmark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;but Miss Vere! How beautifully she spoke those lines at the
      mouth of the cave!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I liked her best in the earlier portions of the play,&rsquo; returned Margaret
      quietly. &lsquo;I have a prejudice against seeing women dressed up in male
      attire. I suppose she is a modest woman, but&mdash;by the way, James, she
      seemed to recognise you? Do you know her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot have met her in society?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was introduced to her by her guardian, White, the dramatic author. We
      have been acquainted for some time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Margaret, more coldly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back her chair, and rose to go. &lsquo;I am very tired. I think I will
      say good-night.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rsquo; exclaimed Forster. &lsquo;I&mdash;I want to
      talk to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About Miss Vere.&rsquo; Then he continued, nervously and hurriedly, &lsquo;I have not
      only a great respect for her, Margaret, but a stronger feeling. I should
      have spoken to you concerning her before, but I had certain reasons for
      keeping silence. Now I think you ought to know everything. I have asked
      her to marry me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Forster gazed at her brother in horror. Her face went ghastly
      pale, and she felt as if a sharp knife had stabbed her to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot be serious!&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite serious!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear James, you are joking with me. I will never believe you capable
      of such folly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think it is folly to marry again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is for you to determine, James; but whenever you marry, you will at
      least marry a lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster&rsquo;s face darkened. &lsquo;He knew his sister&rsquo;s strong prepossessions on
      certain subjects, but he hardly expected so decided an opposition, &lsquo;Listen
      to me, Margaret,&rsquo; he said firmly; &lsquo;and before we go further let me beseech
      you, for my sake, to refrain from saying anything offensive concerning
      Miss Vere. Understand me clearly. I love her&mdash;deeply, passionately;
      and with a man at my age, love means the highest sort of respect. She is
      as far my superior in every gift of nature as I, perhaps, am hers in
      worldly position.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but Margaret made no sign. She kept her cold eyes fixed upon
      his face, as if fascinated by the horror of a degrading confession; but
      her pulses temperately kept time, and her self-control was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat, that I ought possibly to have consulted you earlier on this
      subject, and I am not at all astonished at your surprise. I never thought
      to have married a second time. My first experience, as you know, was not
      encouraging, and since her death you have made my home very happy. My dear
      Margaret, forgive me if I have seemed unkind, but setting aside the
      reasons to which I have alluded, I thought it better not to speak of this
      until I had spoken to Miss Vere. Well, I have spoken, and I thought you
      ought to know the result. That is why I took you to the theatre. That is
      why I have spoken.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again. This time his sister replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, James, you are your own master. I have no right to object.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not the question,&rsquo; he cried impatiently. &lsquo;I should certainly take
      no important step in life without consulting you. I am to understand,
      then, that you object?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To my marrying?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, James. To your marrying a person in Miss Vere&rsquo;s position.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster rose to his feet with an angry exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her position is as good as mine. I am a clod, she is a genius.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is not a lady,&rsquo; returned Margaret, compressing her lips firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heavens, what do you mean? There is not a whisper against her, she
      is divinely gifted, all the world is raving about her. Not a lady! she is
      a queen!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled&mdash;a cold sickly smile of supreme feminine pity.
      Irritated by the smile, and driven out of his usual reticence by the wine
      he had taken at supper, Forster took a rapid turn round the room, and
      then, turning back to his sister, cried in a voice broken with agitation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      II thought you above these shameful prejudices. The profession of an
      actress is one of the noblest under the sun. The same insane bigotry which
      still pursues theatrical performers persecuted until lately all the arts,
      literature and painting more particularly. At the bottom of it all is the
      Church&mdash;the Church which denied Adrienne Lecouvreur Christian burial,
      and which from the beginning of time has been the enemy of light, freedom,
      knowledge.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going on in the same strain when his sister quietly interfered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear James, how absurd! I am very fond of the theatre, as you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you despise those who act.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind. I only desire to see them in their proper place in
      society.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is that, pray?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Among themselves&mdash;in their own artistic world. In point of fact,
      they are much happier there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a moment, Margaret,&rsquo; said Forster, with a short, excited laugh. &lsquo;You
      speak of their world. What is mine? To what sphere do I belong?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You? My dear James, you are a merchant and a gentleman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a <i>tradesman</i>, Margaret, received in certain circles because I
      have so much money, rejected in others because I have neither the birth
      nor the breeding of an aristocrat. The same measure you mete to Miss Vere
      is meted to me&mdash;to you also&mdash;by those who affect to be our
      social superiors. What nonsense it all is! What d&mdash;d nonsense!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Forster shuddered. She had never before in her life heard her
      brother swear, and his use of even so mild an oath showed the situation to
      be desperate. She went up to him gently, and put her cheek for his
      goodnight salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I had better go now,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We are both tired, and if you
      are really in earnest, we can talk it over to-morrow. Good-night, James.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; returned Forster, just touching her cheek with his lips.
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t go till you have heard me out, I have told you that I love Miss
      Vere, and that I have proposed to her, but there is something more.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has refused me&mdash;that is all.&rsquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;WHITE BIDS A LAST FAREWELL TO BOHEMIA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ll this time
      Madeline was dwelling with White in a familiar corner of Bohemia&mdash;a
      quarter of the world which is fast disappearing before the brand-new
      dwellings of artistic gentility&mdash;and which, when it finally
      disappears (as seems inevitable), will take something with it that even
      respectability can never quite replace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwellers in Bohemia, now rapidly disappearing like the dear old
      quarter itself, had many faults and not a few vices, but these were all
      forgotten in the presence of natural charm and irresistible <i>bonhomie</i>.
      They wore great beards, drank beer, and smoked great pipes; their clothes
      were seedy and eccentric, their manners rough and merry, their tastes the
      very reverse of refined; they had very little money, but that little they
      freely shared among one another; they loved late hours, wild talk,
      song-singing, and the social glass; they still regarded the theatre as an
      educational institution, and talked with pagan enthusiasm of the old gods
      of the stage. They were neither very clever nor very wise, and they have
      left no literary monuments to keep their memories fresh; but they enjoyed
      life, and in their own rough way respected the literary craft to which
      they belonged. For them Bohemia was a pleasant place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Marmaduke White was born, and bred, and was, in due season, to die.
      All attempts to coax him to cleaner and cosier quarters were unavailing.
      Although one by one his fellow-Bohemians fell away, corrupted by the
      heresy of respectability and clean linen; although those who were born in
      the same quarter with him listened to the new commercial culte and became
      prosperous men of business; although Jones the novelist drove his brougham
      and frequented genteel parties, while Brown the painter wore fine raiment,
      sold his pictures for splendid prices, and put up at a fashionable club,
      White still remained as he had been&mdash;impecunious, irresponsible,
      generally out-at-elbow. It was his constant complaint that the old
      landmarks were fast changing. &lsquo;If I live long enough,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I shall
      stand on the ruins of the last chop-house and see the last night-house
      turned into a temperance hotel. The downfall of Bohemia dates from the day
      when Thackeray became famous, smoked cigars, and built that nice house at
      Kensington. It is the apotheosis of the Snob. Even at the Garrick, where
      one used to meet all the talent, the Snob is rampant. There is not a <i>foyer</i>
      of the old kind in all London. The literary man has become a commercial
      gent the artist is a spiritualised bagman&mdash;even the actor wears fine
      clothes and goes to swell garden-parties. <i>Sic transit gloria Bohemio!</i>
      I begin to feel like a man who has endured beyond his due time; a sort of
      Wandering Jew, the old clothes-man of an extinct existence and a perished
      creed. I should not so much care if people were much better for the change&mdash;but
      they are not. Fellows are valued now, not for what they are, but for what
      they earn. The very journals are grown brazen-fronted and rave of Mammon.
      A great book is a book that makes a great deal of money; a great artist is
      one who earns a great sum. At my time of life I can&rsquo;t, set up as a swell,
      I like my glass of good beer, and my pipe, and my shirt sleeves. When I
      die my epitaph will be &ldquo;Et ille in Bohemia fuit&rdquo;&mdash;and I suppose I
      shall be the last of the race.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the good man, though he had the perennial heart of a boy, was not
      young. Time, which had dealt gently with his disposition, had thinned his
      once flowing hair, made his limbs feeble, and set many a crowsfoot under
      his kindly eyes. Nor where the habits of the Bohemia he still inhabited
      favourable to longevity. The small hours always found him up, at work or
      play, and he saw little of the early sunshine. He was always behindhand
      with his work, always working against time; feeding irregularly, and at
      unreasonable hours; drinking, alas! more than was good for him, and even
      consuming that nicotine which would destroy even a Promethean liver. He
      had saved nothing, so that rest was denied him; and indeed he could not
      have rested, for he loved labour, in the old, reckless, perfunctory,
      Bohemian way. His old friends had gradually drifted away from him, died
      and been buried, or passed up to those shining social heights where dress
      suits and white linen are provided for aspiring pilgrims. Even managers of
      theatres, grown genteel too, pitied him. &lsquo;Poor White,&rsquo; they would say; &lsquo;he
      is such a Bohemian!&rsquo; So that his occupation partly failed him Good old
      blank-verse plays were no longer in demand. Brand-new adaptors, fresh from
      picking the pockets of French authors in Parisian forays, splashed him
      with the wheels of their triumphal chariots; gorgeous Jew <i>entrepreneurs</i>
      shook their heads at him. &lsquo;Vat ve vant now, my boy, is realism; plenty of
      swell clothes, and upholstery, and last cackle; the public don&rsquo;t vant
      poetry, and as for blank verse, it ventilates de theatre. They&rsquo;ll stand
      Shakespeare now and then, especially when Eugene Aram does it, because
      it&rsquo;s genteel; but all de rest of de drama comsh from France.&rsquo; In his
      anxiety to suit the market he too tried pocket-picking, but he lacked the
      deft rapidity and supreme impudence of the dramatic thief by profession.
      He took too much trouble with work of this kind, and the public found it
      old-fashioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came to pass that from one reason and another, whether because he
      was physically tired out or intellectually weary of a race in which he was
      unevenly handicapped, White began to show signs of failing health. Once or
      twice he took to his bed with some trifling ailment, and on each occasion
      so weak were his bodily powers that he found it hard work to get up again.
      He himself attached no importance to those indications of weakness; he was
      as cheerful to outward seeming, as sanguine, and as full of magnificent
      &lsquo;subjects,&rsquo; as ever. He still sketched out tragedies which no one would
      produce on such pert subjects as &lsquo;Semiramis,&rsquo; &lsquo;Julian the Apostate,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Boadicea,&rsquo; and infinitely laboured comedies full of the spirit of the
      Restoration. His style was still that of the last decadence, when Lalor
      Shiel was a genius and Sheridan Knowles a prophet. He still clung to the
      superstition which placed Bulwer Lytton in the pantheon of tinsel
      divinities. But the game was all over. <i>Et ille in Bohemia fuit</i>,
      that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, or rather early one morning, he came home to the old studio in
      St. John&rsquo;s Wood, evidently under the influence of violent fever. He had
      caught cold, he thought, at the wings of the Duchess&rsquo;s Theatre, and,
      though he had tried the panacea of hot whisky and water, applied in
      allopathic doses, it had only seemed to make him worse. He went to bed,
      and the next day he was unable to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madeline went to his bedside she was shocked at his appearance. He
      looked haggard and old, the great veins on his temple were blue and
      swollen, and he gasped like one who could hardly get his breath. The ghost
      of his old smile came to his face as he reached out his trembling hands,
      which were hot as fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my dear,&rsquo; he said cheerily, but in a strange, faint
      voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite myself, but I shall be all right presently. I think
      it&rsquo;s the effect of Burnard&rsquo;s jokes. He was at the &ldquo;Harum-Scarum&rdquo; last
      night, so I&rsquo;m afraid I partook too freely of pun-salad, which is worse
      than the nightmare-producing lobster.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to laugh, but the laugh died away into a moan, and he sank back
      upon his pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the day the symptoms became so alarming that a physician was
      sent for. He made light of the patient&rsquo;s condition, but wrote him a
      prescription, and ordered him to be kept as quiet as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the next twenty-four hours the symptoms became manifestly those of
      low or gastric fever. Madeline wrote a hurried line for Forster, who came
      almost immediately, accompanied by the celebrated Dr. Tain, well known for
      his kindness to literary men. The good doctor looked somewhat grave, but
      expressed his opinion that the case would yield to treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forward Madeline scarcely left her guardian&rsquo;s bedside,
      ministering to him with infinite tenderness and care. The fever ran its
      course for fourteen days, during several of which White was more or less
      insensible. On the morning of the fourteenth day he opened his eyes, saw
      Madeline seated by his bedside, and smiled brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you there, my dear?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;I was dreaming about you. I thought
      you were a little girl again, and I&mdash;dear me, how weak I feel! Have I
      been very ill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very ill,&rsquo; answered Madeline. &lsquo;But do not talk; the doctor says you must
      not. Let me bring your beef-tea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had ordered him to have beef-tea in liberal portions every
      hour: it was the only way, he said, to combat the fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I shall soon be all right,&rsquo; said White, presently. &lsquo;I must take
      more care of myself for the future, though. I&rsquo;m getting quite an old
      fellow, and must go to bed at ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Tain entered, White looked up and nodded cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am, you see! <i>Pallida Mors</i> won&rsquo;t have me this time, after
      all, and I was thinking that I could eat a mutton chop, well peppered.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor replied cheerfully, and patted White gently on the shoulder;
      but Madeline, catching the expression of his face as he turned away, was
      somewhat troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep him quiet,&rsquo; he whispered to her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll look in again in the afternoon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From this intimation it became clear that the doctor was uneasy. Scarcely
      had he gone when the patient exhibited great restlessness and difficulty
      of breathing; and when the doctor returned in the afternoon he found him
      rambling incoherently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the sick room, he went into the studio, where Forster, whose
      attentions had been unremitting, was impatiently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My fears are realised,&rsquo; said the physician, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peritonitis has supervened.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long it became manifest that White was sinking; as the hours
      progressed he grew weaker and weaker, until the end seemed likely to come
      in stupor. With despairing love and pity, but almost with dry eyes,
      Madeline sat by the bedside; and as she gazed upon the wild, worn face,
      watched the thin, white hand laying outside the coverlet, and heard the
      quiet, monotonous breathing, she already seemed to feel the shadow of
      death upon her life. As one standing safe on some dark river&rsquo;s shore
      watches the struggles of an almost spent drowning man, and forgets
      everything in the intense dread and horror of the contemplation, so she
      watched the sick bed; unable to weep, unable to pray (for, indeed, her
      hopes and fears seldom at any time took the shape of prayer), but feeling
      always as if with the slow ebb of her guardian&rsquo;s life her life was ebbing
      too. For White, she felt, was her only friend in this hard world, the only
      being who knew the full extent of her own sorrow, the only kind soul for
      whom she cared to live. In all her gentle theatrical ambition her thought
      had been of him; how she could bring comfort to his heart, see the pride
      and pleasure kindle on his face, make his old age pleasant, and walk by
      his side the dark descent to the grave. And now, if he left her, what
      remained?
    </p>
    <p>
      In these hours of sorrow the frequent presence of Forster was a secret
      source of irritation to the troubled girl. His very devotion troubled her,
      for she seemed to read in it, not merely friendly kindness and affection,
      but an ever-encroaching assumption of a higher sympathy. He was a good
      man, a true friend, she knew, but she would have loved him far better if
      he had loved her less, and her mind was quite made up&mdash;if her dear
      guardian died, no living man, friend or husband, should ever take his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow came nearer, and it became clear at last that White was
      drifting away beyond all human hope. He suffered little or no pain, but
      momentarily grew weaker. At last one morning he seemed to rally a little,
      and spoke clearly and collectedly on his approaching end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to leave you, my dear,&rsquo; he said softly, while she held his
      hand fondly in her own. &lsquo;I wanted to live a little longer, just to see a
      dear girl at the top of the tree, but I suppose it is all for the best.
      Well, I want you to promise me one thing before I go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not talk so,&rsquo; cried Madeline, kissing the hot hand and sobbing wildly.
      &lsquo;You will get well! We will be so happy together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Madeline! I&rsquo;m not afraid to die, and after all I&rsquo;m an old
      fogey, and the world has left me far behind. I used to think I should live
      to regenerate the drama. Ah, well! that dream is over. I shan&rsquo;t even
      finish &ldquo;Semiramis,&rdquo; the best thing I ever wrote; but you&rsquo;ll give the first
      two acts and the scenario to Eugene Aram when I am gone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and Madeline cried between her sobs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you die, I shall die too! You are my only friend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk like that, my dear. You have a great future before you,
      and perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;I shall be able to see it from afar
      off. If the dead can watch over those they love, I shall still take care
      of you&mdash;ah, yes!&mdash;and if there&rsquo;s a heaven as the preachers say,
      I shall meet poor Fred your father there, and we shall both look down and
      bless you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no father but you! You are all the world to me! You will not die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But White continued quietly, as if pursuing his own thoughts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And while dear Forster lives you will not be without a friend; many a
      time has he lightened my load, and I wish you&rsquo;d let him help you to carry
      yours. If you would promise me to become his wife, I should be very
      happy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot! You know I cannot!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered the words, he became conscious of a movement in the room,
      and looking round saw Forster standing at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Forster?&rsquo; asked White, faintly. &lsquo;Come here, I wish to speak
      to you;&rsquo; and he added when Forster had passed round and stood looking down
      sadly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be kind to Madeline, old fellow, after&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he turned his face on the pillow to hide his tears. Forster did not
      reply in words, but with tears glistening on his own cheeks laid his hand
      softly on the sick man&rsquo;s shoulder. Presently White looked round, and,
      fixing his great dim eyes on Madeline&rsquo;s face, whispered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear! Will you go&mdash;only a little while? I wish to speak to
      Forster.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent over the bed and kissed him tenderly on the forehead; then with a
      sob as if her heart was breaking she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the next chamber, a small room overlooking the garden, and,
      sitting at the window, looked out through streaming tears. Many minutes
      passed, and at last, anxious and impatient, she rose to return to her
      post. As she did so, Forster appeared at the door and beckoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come now?&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;He is asking for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped softly in, and approached the bedside. With a smile of
      ineffable love and tenderness the dying man turned his face up to hers
      and, reaching out his tremulous hands, gave one to her, the other to
      Forster; then he said in a voice so indistinct that they had to stoop
      their heads to catch the word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have spoken to Forster... he will take care of of you, my dear... a
      good fellow... always my best friend, God bless him... now I can go in
      peace.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then feebly but firmly he drew the two hands together and joined them;
      that of Madeline lay in that of Forster, with the fingers of the dying man
      encircling both; and she did not draw hers away for fear of disturbing her
      dear guardian&rsquo;s last moments. In this position he closed his eyes, and
      seemed to doze. A little while after the breath fluttered, the feeble
      frame trembled, and the gentle spirit was gone for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      What followed was to Madeline a dark and painful dream. Ever wild and
      impressionable in her grief as well as her joyful impulses, she yielded to
      such a storm of grief as threatened for a time to overthrow her reason.
      During this time of sorrow Madame de Berny watched her with maternal
      tenderness, and the touch of her tender ministration brought a certain
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the first wild shock was over, the brave disposition of the girl
      asserted itself, and, hushing the tumult of her pain, she went with Madame
      de Berny to see the place which Forster had chosen for his friend&rsquo;s last
      resting-place, It was a pretty spot, in a green corner of the cemetery at
      Hampstead, with green boughs all round, flowers on every side, and the
      spires of the great city in the distance; and standing here, near the
      place chosen for the grave, Madeline could hear the chimes of London
      sounding faint and far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day of the funeral came, she went as chief mourner, for her soul
      revolted at the cruel custom which keeps our womankind from following the
      dead. She stood by the side of the grave, heard the solemn words of
      blessing, and saw the coffin lowered to its place; and she raised her
      weeping face to the bright skies, praying and believing that her
      guardian&rsquo;s spirit had gone <i>there</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near her that day stood a motley crowd of artistic Bohemians, bearded men
      for the most part, shabby of apparel, but full of honest grief; some of
      them, with true tears in their eyes, came softly up to speak a few words
      of sympathy to the mourning girl; and she loved the rough fellows for
      their resemblance to him who had passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Madeline went back to the home that was home no longer, and thought
      day and night of the beloved dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was many weeks after these sad events that Forster came one day to St.
      John&rsquo;s Wood, and found Madeline still sitting in the shadow of her great
      grief; but she had found one sweet comfort in looking over her guardian&rsquo;s
      papers and placing them in order with her loving hand, for she remembered
      one lifelong dream of the poor Bohemian&mdash;to see his beloved plays
      arranged together and published in book form; and she thought to herself
      that the world should know what a beautiful genius it had lost, when it
      saw the creatures of his imagination gathered together for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Forster came they talked for some time of the proposed publication.
      An old friend of White, eminent as a critic and a dramatic poet, was to
      revise the work, and prepare it with a short biography, and at the end of
      the book were to be printed a few last memorials, and some obituary verses
      by members of the Bohemian Club, to which White had belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, Forster changed the subject, and spoke of the wish
      which was still nearest his heart. Then, when Madeline turned away as if
      shocked and pained, he took her hand and said earnestly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was <i>his</i> wish, do not forget that. He knew I loved you, and he
      joined our hands together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said Madeline. &lsquo;Do not speak of it&mdash;he knew it was
      impossible&mdash;he could not wish it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, he <i>did</i> wish it, with all his heart. Listen to me, my
      darling! That day before he joined our hands together he asked to speak to
      me alone&mdash;do you remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know what he wished to say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wished to tell me something concerning yourself. &ldquo;Forster,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I tell you these things because I trust you before God, because I think
      that it is best that you should know, and because I feel you will never
      love my darling less.&rdquo; Then, Madeline, he told me why you refused to marry
      me, why you had said you would never marry any living man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale as death, Madeline turned her face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He told you that!&rsquo; she murmured, shivering as if chilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He told me everything, my darling; and now, knowing everything, knowing
      your great sorrow, and knowing and loving you a thousandfold, I ask you
      again to become my wife.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;MADELINE CHANGES HER NAME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few months later
      the following announcement appeared amongst the &lsquo;Births, Deaths, and
      Marriages,&rsquo; on the first page of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>On the 23rd, at Christ Church, Hampstead, James Forster, of Hampden
      House, Cromwell Road, South Kensington, to Madeline, only daughter of the
      late Fred. Hazelmere, Esq., of the Inner Temple.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few of those who read this announcement were aware that the lady in
      question was the young actress known under another name to the audiences
      of the Theatre Royal Parthenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very quiet marriage. After the ceremony the newly married couple
      drove to the cemetery, in the immediate neighbourhood, and Madeline placed
      a fresh garland on White&rsquo;s grave; then with a heavy heart she returned to
      a quiet wedding breakfast, to which only a few very intimate friends were
      invited, and in the afternoon departed with her husband to Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before that wedding day Madeline had discovered, by secret
      inquisition of her own heart, that the tender respect she felt lor James
      Forster was not yet love&mdash;not such love, at least, as blends the
      lives of man and woman in perfect sympathy and joy; and she would have
      given the world, therefore, if he had been content to remain what he had
      been&mdash;her friend, her brother, her benefactor. But seeing clearly
      that his happiness depended on the formation of a closer relationship,
      she, by slow degrees, was reconciled to the possibility. What weighed with
      her more than any other consideration was the thought of poor White&rsquo;s last
      injunction. He had wished this union&mdash;had, indeed, enjoined it upon
      her&mdash;so that to shrink from fulfilling his fond request seemed
      selfish and ungrateful, and the more so as she remembered so vividly the
      noble and unselfish devotion of Forster during all the last years of poor
      White&rsquo;s earthly struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she consented, not without many secret tears and forebodings, for the
      shadow of her first cruel experience was still upon her, and she could not
      stifle the secret sense of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before finally yielding her hand, however, she questioned Forster again,
      and more explicitly, concerning his secret interview with White, just
      before the latter&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish me to be your wife,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but are you sure that you know
      what you are asking? I feel quite an old woman, and I am not good enough
      to be your wife. Sometimes, even now, the old restless fit is on me, the
      old wicked wilfulness. I shall never bring happiness to any one, I am
      sure.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are unjust to yourself. Dear Madeline, trust me. I will try to
      deserve your trust.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know that there are some things, some thoughts and acts, which seem
      to pollute the very air we breathe; to make the bright world hateful; to
      chill the very heart within us, like the touch of death? I feel like a
      girl who has been shrouded for the grave and who still exists, but who
      will never have the wholesome, happy life of good people. Do not ask me to
      marry. Choose some innocent girl, and give your love to her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot love as we will,&rsquo; said Forster, earnestly, &lsquo;but as God wills;
      and I have given my love to you. Dearest, it is just because you have been
      unhappy that I yearn to bring you happiness; just because you have been
      wronged that I long to make amends. You must leave these sorrowful
      thoughts behind you; you must rise from the tomb of your dead grief, and
      live anew.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot; it is too late.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you are so young, so beautiful; and I love you so much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not deserve such love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You deserve far more than I can bring you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Mr. White tell you what I had been? Do not turn away, but look me in
      the face&mdash;you see I am not afraid. What did he say to you? Tell me
      everything.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He told me that you had been deceived by a villain, who afterwards
      abandoned you. Dearest, he did you full justice&mdash;he knew that you
      were innocent, an angel deluded by a devil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not innocent,&rsquo; returned Madeline, sadly. &lsquo;I was to blame, and ah! I
      was so ungrateful. If I had been innocent, do you think I should ever have
      placed myself in that man&rsquo;s power?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were very young, and it is an evil world. Do not speak of it again.
      Bury the past, and become my honoured wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say that now; but some day, years hence, perhaps, the past would rise
      like a ghost, and your life would be darkened by regret and shame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never by shame! never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not fit to make connections, I am not fit to have friends; it is
      better for such women as I to be alone in the world, and then, if shame
      comes, it falls only on the one who has the most right to suffer. It is
      this thought that reconciles me to the death of my dear guardian. I am
      alone in the world now, and can bring harm to no one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To a man like Forster it was terrible to hear her talk so. He was willing
      to forget the past, and he saw no dark cloud looming in the future. He had
      set his heart on making Madeline his wife, and he would never rest until
      his object had been attained. &lsquo;She hesitates to take the plunge,&rsquo; he said
      to himself, &lsquo;but once she has taken it all will be well.&rsquo; So he pleaded
      and pleaded, until at length Madeline was brought to consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a short honeymoon, but to Madeline, at least, it was a tolerably
      happy one. She had refused to take a maid with her, and he had consented
      to dispense with the services of a valet, so they spent their days in
      happy unconcern, roaming about among the Swiss mountains, travelling from
      one picturesque village to another, and living in little quaint rustic
      inns, whose primitive accommodation would have made Miss Forster turn cold
      with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just the kind of life which Madeline loved. After all, the
      unnatural atmosphere of town smoke and footlights had not left much taint
      upon her; she felt once more the little girl who, with tangled hair and
      disordered dress, had raced like a young untrained colt about the marshes
      of Grayfleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the pleasures of the honeymoon were not destined to continue. Forster,
      though a rich man, could never be spared long from the office&mdash;so at
      the end of a month he told his young wife that the two must turn their
      faces towards home. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the penalty of marrying a City man,&rsquo; he said;
      &lsquo;things always seem to go wrong when I&rsquo;m away; and though I grumble about
      the office a good deal, I think, after all, I like it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have to leave you a good deal alone, my darling.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind that. While you are away I&rsquo;ll be thinking what I can do to
      make you comfortable when you come home again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing, my dear. I&rsquo;ll not have my Madeline made a
      drudge. You&rsquo;ll enjoy yourself as you do now, and my sister is quite
      willing to look after things a bit. She&rsquo;s used to it, and doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Forster?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Margaret.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she going to live with us?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, yes, I suppose so. You see she has lived with me for years, and it
      never occurred to me that you would wish her to go. She will be very
      useful to you, Madeline; besides, she&rsquo;ll be company for you while I&rsquo;m
      away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Madeline said nothing. She felt she had no right to object to this
      arrangement, but she was sorry it had been made. However, for her
      husband&rsquo;s sake she resolved to make the best of it, and to look upon Miss
      Forster henceforth as an affectionate sister and friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, about a month after the wedding-day, a carriage and pair
      drove up to the door of Forster&rsquo;s town house, the large handsomely
      furnished mansion in South Kensington, and Forster, alighting, handed out
      his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Welcome home, my darling,&rsquo; he said, giving her hand a tender pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline&rsquo;s heart bounded at the touch, and, with flushed cheek and
      sparkling eyes, she ran up the steps to the open door. On the threshold
      stood Miss Forster, with a distant smile and a cordial &lsquo;how do you do?&rsquo;
      Madeline held forth both her hands, but the lady&rsquo;s stately figure became
      more stately as she coldly placed her fingers in one of the palms, and
      graciously led the way into the house. Somewhat chilled at so cold a
      greeting, Madeline followed her through a stately hall into a handsomely
      furnished room. Madeline sat down, and Miss Forster paused before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will be so good as to give me your keys,&rsquo; she said politely, &lsquo;your
      maid shall unpack your things. James asked me to engage one for you, and I
      hope she will give satisfaction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a nod and a smile Madeline handed over the keys, and Miss Forster
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline sighed, leaned back in her chair, and looked around her. She was
      in the drawing-room of Hampden House, a spacious apartment, elegantly
      furnished in the most costly style. Her eyes, carelessly scanning the
      costly pictures which covered the walls, became suddenly fixed upon one.
      She leapt up from her seat, ran over to it, stood for a moment regarding
      it with tear-dimmed gaze. Then, raising herself on tiptoe, she pressed
      upon it her warm, ripe, trembling lips. It was a pretty little landscape,
      looking insignificant enough in its golden setting, but trebly dear to
      Madeline, for it was almost the last picture which poor White had painted.
      Saddened a little at the memory it brought her, she stood looking at it in
      a dream; she felt the tears roll slowly down her cheeks, the sobs contract
      her throat&mdash;she was growing almost hysterical, when a voice recalled
      her to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I show you to your rooms?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, turned, and found herself face to face with her husband&rsquo;s
      sister. Unable to hide her tears, she said, turning faintly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, I think I should like to be alone. I feel rather tired and
      depressed to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forster said nothing, but quietly led the way out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the best rooms in the house had been fitted up for Madeline&rsquo;s
      special use, and as she walked into them she felt for the first time that
      day that she had really come home. Here, as elsewhere, there were splendid
      upholstery, splendid pictures, tastefully designed ceilings, and dim
      rose-coloured curtains to moderate the light; but besides all this
      Madeline saw some of the crude but well-loved pictures which brought to
      her the fond memory of her guardian; there was a little bookcase,
      containing his favourite volumes; and, above all, there were his favourite
      plays. She saw all this, but she saw more. Passing on through the
      sitting-room she looked into the dressing-room adjoining it. She found her
      dresses laid out, and a smart maid kneeling before a box which was half
      unpacked. The girl rose and asked which dress her mistress would wear for
      dinner, but Madeline said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; any one; will you leave me alone, please: and when I want
      you I will ring.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid retired, and Madeline, left to herself, returned to the
      sitting-room. She took off her bonnet and cloak, and sat down in an easy
      chair close to a gipsy table on which stood a silver tray and some tea.
      She poured out a cup, and, while sipping it, looked with dubious eyes
      around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ought to be happy,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;So I am; so I will be. He is so good and
      kind! I trust to God he will never be made to repent. If his sister knew&mdash;if
      the world knew&mdash;but why should they?&mdash;I cannot undo the past,
      but I can guide the future. Yes, I will bury my dead, as he said, and try
      to forget.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light tap upon the door. Madeline started up, but before she could speak
      the door opened and a tiny figure came in&mdash;a little bright-eyed boy,
      who ran forward with outstretched hands, and sprang with a joyful cry into
      her lap. She clasped him fondly in her arms, and kissed him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My darling, you have come to bid me welcome home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mamma.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who sent you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa. Kiss me again, please. Papa says if I am good you are sure to love
      me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up his rosy lips and she kissed them again and again; then she
      caught him up in her arms and carried him to her dressing-room. She turned
      over the things in her unpacked boxes and produced some toys&mdash;these
      she gave to the child, embracing him the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know why I brought these, dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mamma, unless because, as papa says, you are so good.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said quietly, &lsquo;it is because I love you, and I want you to love
      me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night Madeline came quietly down from her room and entered the
      library. Forster was still there; he was smoking a cigar, and looking
      through a batch of letters which had accumulated during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Madeline, can&rsquo;t you sleep?&rsquo; he asked, as she came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, James, not till I have thanked you for all your goodness to me. Tell
      me, how can I repay you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By being happy in your home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good advice, and for a time at least Madeline followed it. She was happy.
      Her husband was a good deal away, but she had always his boy to comfort
      her, and upon the child she lavished all the affection of her impulsive
      heart. There was one thing only in the house which chilled and repelled
      her; it was the presence of her husband&rsquo;s sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline had not been long in the house before she found that the cold
      eyes of Margaret Forster watched her continually in suspicious distrust,
      as if trying in vain to penetrate the mystery which shrouded the young
      girl&rsquo;s life. But this Madeline soon forgot. Why should she fear Miss
      Forster? The past was buried; and as yet she had no idea that the future
      had its hidden mystery to disclose.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;THE PUPIL OF THE IMPECCABLE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin the charmed
      circle to which he was introduced by Ponto, Gavrolles was popular in the
      extreme. He possessed all the enthusiasm of the aesthetics, combined with
      an impudence and a knowledge of the world&mdash;especially of the gay
      world of Paris&mdash;which were exquisitely charming. He knew all the wits
      and poets of the Empire, and his acquaintance with <i>scabreux</i>
      literature was profound; yet he had sat at the feet of Victor Hugo, and
      was a Republican by profession. His own verses had been praised by the
      impeccable Gautier. He could talk glibly of Art for Art&rsquo;s sake, of the
      heresy of instruction, of Villon and Bohemia, and of the Renaissance. He
      wore his hair long, had a willowy droop of the shoulders, and adored the
      <i>culte</i> of the lily. He had a shrill style, a shrill voice, a shrill
      disposition. Inspired young ladies found him charming, feeble young
      gentlemen paid him the homage of imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to London, Gavrolles took rooms in one of the bye-streets
      near Portland Place. They were rather high up, but he had them furnished
      in the best æsthetic style, with a few risky pictures and a small
      collection of books. &lsquo;Come and see me,&rsquo; he would say; &lsquo;I am only a poor
      artiste, but I have my books, and in these I live.&rsquo; On the whole they were
      not nice books&mdash;a Philistine might have even called them nasty; but
      many of them bore the autographs of the writers, and were priceless
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the name of Gavrolles began to be a good deal talked
      about, as that of a young Frenchman with Communist views who had written
      some delightfully wicked volumes of verse. The &lsquo;Megatherium,&rsquo; inspired by
      Ponto, had a good deal to say about him, classing him in the great bagnio
      of Art somewhere by the side of Gautier and Baudelaire; and taking
      occasion at the same time to express its horror of realists like Zola, who
      called a spade a spade, and reduced the fair features of vice to a <i>caput
      mortuum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, Crieff, who knew everybody, took Sutherland to the lodgings of
      Gavrolles, and introduced him. Quite a little symposium was there,
      including Ponto the fatuous; Cassius Gass, a lean and limp critic from
      Cambridge; Blanco Serena, and several other painters; young Botticelli
      Jones, and one or two more callow poets, not to speak of Wallace MacNeill,
      the editor of the &lsquo;Megatherium.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland sat very silent. After the first, quick look at Gavrolles, and
      a second shock of recognition, he remained quiescent, but quietly
      observant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk was of &lsquo;Lily and Rue,&rsquo; an anonymous poem which had just appeared,
      and which Ponto had just criticised with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder who is the writer?&rsquo; said Botticelli Jones. &lsquo;There are passages
      in it which are worthy of Byron.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Byron was a Philistine,&rsquo; cried Ponto; &lsquo;he could never have written a
      piece of this kind. Look at the technique of his verse! It would disgrace
      a schoolboy! No, this is a cameo cut by an artist.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I confess it!&rsquo; observed Gavrolles, smiling languidly. &lsquo;I am of
      Henri Taine&rsquo;s opinion, and prefer to your Byron our Alfred de Musset.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Crieff, who was puffing carelessly at a briar-root pipe, threw
      himself back in his chair and laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! Is it possible you don&rsquo;t know?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That MacAlpine&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder ran through the assemblage at the mention of the hated name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That MacAlpine has acknowledged the authorship of this poem.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What poem?&rsquo; demanded Ponto, trembling and turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of &ldquo;Lily and Eue.&rdquo; Go and buy the third edition&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find
      his name on the title-page.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible silence followed. The men looked in horror at one another. One
      man rose, livid and ghastly, put his hand to his head and left without a
      word. It was the editor of the &lsquo;Megatherium.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor MacNeill,&rsquo; cried Crieff, with another laugh. &lsquo;This is the second
      trick of the kind that MacAlpine has played him; this is the second time
      that he has devoted columns of praise to an author whom he would gladly
      see handed over, like the old heretics, to the secular arm. It only shows
      what humbug criticism is!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; said Gass the critic, hysterically, &lsquo;criticism is not humbug.
      It would be easy to show, on a profounder examination of this disagreeable
      work, that it is the work of a Philistine. The over-accentuation of the
      sensuous passages (which, by the way, are not sensuous, but prurient and
      ponderous), the want of finish in the trochaic couplets, the crudeness of
      the poetic terminology&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would all have been evident enough,&rsquo; interrupted Crieff, dryly, &lsquo;if
      MacAlpine&rsquo;s name had been on the title-page. Without that, even superhuman
      insight, like yours, could not detect them.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he laughed again; but no one joined in the laugh except Blanco Serena,
      who was not a little amused. There was a general feeling of discomfort, to
      relieve which Gavrolles went to his bookcase, and took down several new
      importations from France. Passed from hand to hand, these works were
      freely and generally discussed; but when they reached Crieff, that rude
      person again shocked the sensibilities of his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The literature of the Lollipop,&rsquo; he said with a grin. &lsquo;Somehow I never
      touch any of it without feeling nasty; &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; all over, as it were.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the mind of a Philistine,&rsquo; observed the critic Gass, severely, &lsquo;such
      things do not appeal. I regret to see that a certain person, who shall be
      nameless, is drifting more and more into moral Philistinism. Well, he will
      at least be able to say, &ldquo;Et ego in Arcadia fui,&rdquo; when it is too late to
      return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crieff laughed good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it is my early training,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and the fact that I was
      taught to respect all women in the person of my mother. But here is my
      friend Sutherland, who is a Philistine of Philistines, for he actually
      believes, with St. Benedict, that the law of purity is binding upon both
      sexes alike, and in his benighted eyes your Gautier, your Baudelaire, and
      &ldquo;hoc genus omne&rdquo; are simply dirty descendants of Sir Pandarus of Troy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sincerely hope you are libelling your friend,&rsquo; observed the critic,
      glancing at Sutherland. &lsquo;Personal purity, as you call it, is simply a
      reminiscence of asceticism, and one of the many fallacies we owe to the
      mediaeval perversions of Christianity.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bosh,&rsquo; returned Crieff, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland, who throughout the conversation had scarcely taken his eyes
      off Gavrolles, now spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am neither an ascetic nor a Puritan, but I must frankly confess that
      the literature you are discussing excites my strongest abhorrence.
      Whatever is unfit for a pure woman to read is unfit to be read by a pure
      man. Would you give these books to your wives and sisters&mdash;that is
      the question?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; cried Ponto from the other side of the room. &lsquo;Provided their
      aesthetic education had been complete, they would find nothing but
      pleasure from the perusal. Why in Heaven&rsquo;s name should Woman remain for
      ever the slave of Virtue? I would make her the archpriestess of the
      Beautiful, ministering to mortals in all the passionate nudity of Art.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, monsieur?&rsquo; said Sutherland, turning suddenly to Gavrolles. &lsquo;What
      is your opinion?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I am an artiste,&rsquo; answered the Frenchman, with a shrug of the
      shoulders and an unpleasant smile. &lsquo;I, too, would make woman the priestess
      of Beauty. Ah, yes, with the greatest of possible pleasure!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were of little meaning, but the tone was significant, and a
      titter went round the room. Sutherland&rsquo;s face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I presume that your experience of the sex is large?&rsquo; he asked in a low
      voice. &lsquo;Gentlemen of your nation are generally fortunate&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no exception to the rule,&rsquo; answered Gavrolles. &lsquo;My whole life has
      been <i>une bonne fortune!</i> But look you, as I say, I am an artiste&mdash;in
      affairs of gallantry as in all others. I do not suffer these things to
      cloud the equanimity of my artiste&rsquo;s soul. When I have plucked a rose&mdash;observe!
      I smell it; I wear it a little while; then I take it from my button-hole
      and throw it away. You understand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; said Sutherland, rising to his feet. &lsquo;Pray does it ever
      occur to you what becomes of the rose afterwards! If it is trampled
      underfoot, who is responsible?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, that is the rose&rsquo;s affair, not mine. <i>Au reste</i>, roses
      must bloom and fade; Art, Art&mdash;for which I live&mdash;is imperishable
      and divine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to say whether he was jesting or in earnest, for his manner
      was peculiar, a combination of mock-enthusiasm and flippant audacity. But
      despite his appearance of <i>sang-froid</i>, something in the face and
      manner of Sutherland thrilled him, and reminded him of an unpleasant
      meeting many years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed profoundly as Sutherland prepared to go, and held out his hand&mdash;which
      the other did not seem to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rsquo;he said gaily; &lsquo;and <i>au revoir</i>, Monsieur Crieff.
      My friend Ponto will convert you presently; ah, yes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute Crieff and Sutherland were in the street. The latter was
      very pale, and trembled violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Sutherland, what is the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing; only that man&rsquo;s face and his talk have upset me. I could have
      strangled him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an excitable fellow you are!&rsquo; said Crieff, taking his arm. &lsquo;Upon my
      life, you take these things far too seriously. The other day you were
      seriously angry with Lagardère, and here you are actually distressing
      yourself over the prattle of a child like Gavrolles.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not understand. I know the man, and have reason to remember him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That alters the case. Where did you meet?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In France&mdash;some years ago.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crieff listened for further explanations, but none came. Pressed to say
      more, Sutherland shook his head, and relapsed into silence; so the little
      journalist proceeded to give his muscular friend a lesson in social
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too thoroughly in earnest, and in company your earnestness makes
      other people uncomfortable. Life would be impossible if every bit of idle
      chit-chat or <i>ad captandum</i> argument were taken <i>au sérieux</i>.
      Looked at in the proper light, Gavrolles is charming&mdash;a droll
      creature with a touch of genius. To you he is merely a dissolute young
      man, who reads improper books.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To me,&rsquo; returned Sutherland, fiercely, &lsquo;he is a thorough scoundrel, whom
      I should like to choke.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crieff soon perceived that remonstrance was useless, and, mentally
      determining not to introduce his companion to any more choice spirits, he
      changed the subject. The pair soon parted, Crieff to stroll down to the
      gallery of the House of Commons, Sutherland to pace the solitary streets,
      full of the troubled recollections awakened by that chance encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on that evening Gavrolles sat alone in his lodgings. He now
      recollected Sutherland perfectly, and roundly cursed the unlucky chance
      which had occasioned a second meeting. On reflection, however, he felt
      confident that the Englishman could do him no serious damage in the eyes
      of his new acquaintances, even if he attempted to do so, which was
      doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clock struck eight he lit a cigar and strolled out into the
      streets. As he walked along, his attention was attracted by a theatre bill
      in one of the shop windows. One of the names struck him immediately as
      that of the young actress whose portrait he had seen in the studio of
      Blanco Serena. He looked at the name of the theatre; it was the Theatre
      Royal Parthenon. He strolled away in the direction of that building.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the theatre, however, he found the doors closed, and
      discovered that the theatrical season had ended on the previous Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strolling carelessly along, he entered one of the smaller theatres in the
      Strand, a house devoted to opera bouffe. He paid his money and got a seat
      in the back row of the pit. There, perspiring and half-suffocated, he was
      listening to the hideous din and watching the insane performance upon the
      stage, when his attention was attracted by a movement in a box above him,
      and glancing up he beheld a face he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of a woman, young and very beautiful, though trifle pale and sad.
      She was plainly clad in black satin, with an opera cloak of snowy white,
      with fringe of down encircling her white neck. No ornaments in her hair,
      no jewels on her person, and surely she needed neither, for her simple
      pathetic beauty was better unadorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her was a gentleman, not young, but with the fresh face and manners
      of a boy. He looked very happy and proud, and gazed less at the stage than
      at his companion, as, indeed, was natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two were our heroine and her husband, James Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      A child might have gathered, from the man&rsquo;s looks of pleasure and
      admiration, that Forster loved the beautiful creature by his side. His
      eyes scarcely left her, he was eager to respond to her slightest look or
      word. When she talked, he hung upon her speech; and when she was silent he
      waited for her to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles comprehended the situation directly&mdash;almost as rapidly as
      he recognised Madeline. For the rest of the evening he occupied himself in
      looking up, with a keen and cat-like gaze. How beautiful she seemed! How
      much fairer and riper than when he had seen her last, in her wild girlish
      <i>gaucherie! Pardieu</i>, she was a child then; but <i>now!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As he gazed his thoughts went back to the days when he had seen her first,
      a giddy schoolgirl, a very will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp among the decorous young
      French damsels of the ladies&rsquo; seminary. He remembered her wild ways, her
      odd sayings in schoolgirl&rsquo;s French, her pretty fits of petulance, her
      innocent entanglement with him, the ever-seductive Gavrolles&mdash;or
      Belleisle, as he then called himself. He thought of the mad elopement, and
      the strange days that followed, when the fluttering bird was in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he reflected, &lsquo;I was a fool to let her go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man with her, who seemed so greatly to adore her, who was he?
      Surely her lover; perhaps her husband&mdash;but no, that was scarcely
      possible. A rich man, certainly; yes, with all the style and manner of a
      rich man. She, too, with her popular fame, her great artistic position,
      was no longer poor. Perhaps, after all, it was for the best that he had
      let her go, since fortune had been kind to her, and what was lost could be
      easily regained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles smiled. Once, when the audience was busy applauding the actors,
      his exhilaration was so great that he impulsively kissed his hand in the
      direction of the box. The action was unnoticed, of course, but it seemed
      to place him <i>en rapport</i> with his old love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Courage, Gavrolles!&rsquo; he said to himself. &lsquo;You are Fortune&rsquo;s favourite,
      after all. Just when you were in despair, just when your purse was empty
      and your great soul in despair, the cards befriend you, and a good angel
      appears in the distance. Madeline, <i>mon ange</i>, I greet you. You will
      be my guardian spirit after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the opera was over, Gavrolles stood in the corner of the box lobby,
      and watched Madeline go past on Forster&rsquo;s arm. He kept his face well
      averted, for he did not wish to be recognised, just yet. Then, following
      the pair to the theatre door, he saw a brougham draw up, smiled upon the
      pair as they entered and gaily lit a cigar as they drove away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;ADELE LAMBERT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>igar in mouth,
      Gavrolles strolled leisurely along the streets in the direction of Regent
      Circus. Arrived in Waterloo Place he found the pavement thronged with
      those painted faces,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Which only smile by night beneath the gas,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and saw what, to a man with any pity in his soul, is the saddest sight
      beneath the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright jets of gas were flaming over the Criterion Restaurant, the night
      houses on every side were opening their foul jaws, and from the darkness
      of every street and lane were fluttering forth the moths of night. Painted
      and bedizened creatures, fluttering gladly in the gaslight; some faint and
      feeble, as if already scorched with the destroying flame; others
      splendidly merry, with the new flush of the infernal brightness upon them;
      many beautiful beyond measure, with faces as pure and sweet as those of
      little children that know not sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the smile and swagger of one who knew his company, Gavrolles made his
      way from group to group, accosted from time to time by some passing
      figure, and more than once plucked softly by the sleeve. Once, as he
      paused under a lamplight, a slight form, clad in the thinnest of silk,
      paused before him, and a baby face leered hideously up into his; but he
      pushed the shape softly aside, and swaggered on. To him, as to many of his
      class, the sight was quite proper and pleasant; his fine nerves were not
      shocked, his noble soul was not sadly stirred; indeed, such a man might
      walk confidently by the side of the very flames of Hell, and be conscious
      of nothing but the picturesque lights and shadows of the dreadful place.
      Yes, for as Swedenborg has sublimely guessed, Hell is Heaven to the
      devilish nature, and the penalty of the morally damned is not to <i>know</i>
      that it is Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far away, that very night, walked another man, one of nobler fibre,
      with the shuddering sense of infinite pity and despair. He, too, was
      familiar with the sight of moral leprosy and spiritual disease, and as he
      gazed on those painted things, all and each of whom were infected with the
      <i>goitre</i> of incurable infamy, he felt weary of the world. &lsquo;So long as
      this is possible,&rsquo; thought Edgar Sutherland, &lsquo;how can the dead Christ
      rise?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the street at the Quadrant, Sutherland saw, standing in the
      lamplight of the corner, two figures, one an elderly woman with a face
      swollen and deformed by drink, the other a wild-looking girl, poorly clad,
      coughing violently as if in sharp physical pain. As he was passing he
      heard them speak to each other in French; he paused and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a fool, Adèle,&rsquo; said the elder woman. &lsquo;Come and have some brandy&mdash;you
      will be all right then.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed hoarsely and uttered a coarse oath, then the cough seized
      her again with a paroxysm so violent that her whole frame shook like a
      leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devil take the cough,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I shall have to go into the hospital
      after all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more words passed, and then the elder woman, impatient to reach the
      bar of some neighbouring public-house, ran across the street. The young
      girl was feebly following, when Sutherland stepped forward, lifting his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good evening, mademoiselle,&rsquo; he said, speaking in her own language. &lsquo;I am
      afraid you are ill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the tone startled her, and the gentle voice, the respectful
      gesture, acted like a charm. She replied courteously, with a polite
      inclination of the head, &lsquo;I am not very well, monsieur; I have been ill
      for some time.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry. If you will take my advice you will go home&mdash;you
      are not fit to be in the streets.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him strangely, and then said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, monsieur, but you are not a Frenchman?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I have seen your face before? You have been abroad,&mdash;in
      Brussels?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, something in her form and face seemed familiar; with an
      exclamation he took her by the arm, and drew her close under the light of
      the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Adèle Lambert? Do you remember me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That she did so was now clear; for with a hysterical cry she shrank from
      him and hid her face in her hands. Two years before, in Brussels, he had
      found this poor creature, then a pretty girl, in the power of infamous
      people, who had decoyed her to ruin; with infinite trouble and great
      pecuniary expense he had released her and restored her to her friends; and
      when he had last heard of her she seemed on the threshold of a new and
      purer life. And now, this was the sequel! He shuddered in horror, as he
      looked upon her spectral face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor girl,&rsquo; he said gently, &lsquo;what brought you to England?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told him, with many tears; for the sight of him and the
      remembrance of his former charity touched the deep springs of sorrow in
      her poor outcast soul. She had indeed gone home, but not to stay. Soon
      after her return her mother had died, and her father had taken another
      wife; her life was not happy, and the taint of her shame still clung to
      her; and at last, in despair, she had drifted back to Brussels, finding
      all ways of life closed to her but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And since then, monsieur. I have suffered so much. I was never strong,
      and now I am&mdash;as you see. A year ago they took me to the hospital in
      my own country&mdash;would to God I had died there! but I came out, and
      after that I went from bad to worse. Two months ago I came with that woman
      to England. I thought no one would know me here, and now&mdash;is it not
      strange?&mdash;I meet with <i>you</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, another figure came sauntering up in the full light of the
      lamp. It was Gavrolles, indifferent and happy, smoking his cigar. The
      moment the girl&rsquo;s eyes fell upon him, her manner changed; and, to
      Sutherland&rsquo;s astonishment, she uttered a cry, and rushed up to the
      newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me look at your face,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Quick! It is he!&rsquo; And she clung
      with strange fury to Gavrolles, who in vain attempted to shake her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; he said in English The woman is drunk. I will call the
      police.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a fierce shriek she raised her hand and struck at his face with her
      clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You devil! You devil!&rsquo; she cried in French. &lsquo;I have been waiting so long
      to see you, and now at last we meet. If I had a knife I would stab you. It
      is I&mdash;Adèle.&rsquo; &lsquo;I do not know you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is false. You are a liar and a devil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she struck him in the face with both hands. Livid and trembling,
      Gavrolles threw her off; she fell back screaming, and would have fallen
      had not Sutherland caught her in his arms. While he held her she struggled
      madly, hysterical with an overmastering passion. A crowd of outcast women
      and well-dressed men already surrounded them, and a policeman, pushing his
      way into the circle, roughly demanded the cause of the disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Only a drunken woman, as you see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman approached the girl and touched her on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come now, just you move on, or I&rsquo;ll have to run you in,&rsquo; he said; and as
      she spoke rapidly in her own language, he shook his sagacious head and
      continued, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want none of your parleyvoo. Leave the gentleman
      alone, d&rsquo;ye hear, and move on.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The woman is not drunk,&rsquo; said Sutherland. &lsquo;She is ill, and&mdash;look,
      she has fainted!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Overmastered by her excitement, she had indeed fallen into a sort of faint
      or fit. Sutherland supported her gently, while the crowd, with cries and
      murmurs, pressed close! round them. In the commotion which ensued
      Gavrolles slipped away, stepped into a hansom, and was driven off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep back&mdash;give her air!&rsquo; cried Sutherland. &lsquo;Does any one know where
      she lives?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the woman whom he had first seen in her company stepped
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, monsieur, we lodge together. Look up, Adèle! What ails you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Help me to take her home,&rsquo; said Sutherland, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman called a cab, and Sutherland raised the girl in his arms and
      placed her in it; then he stepped in himself, followed by the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove to a wretched lodging-house in Gerrard Street, Soho, a dismal
      fetid den, presided over by a hideous old Frenchwoman, who at first
      refused to take her in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better drive her to the hospital,&rsquo; said this person, blocking the
      doorway. &lsquo;She owes me two weeks&rsquo; rent already, and I can&rsquo;t take care of
      her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Sutherland&rsquo;s purse, however, worked wonders; and with many
      protestations of sympathy the hag suffered the girl to be carried to a
      room upstairs. The fainting fit had by this time passed away, to be
      followed by an attack of hysterical weeping and coughing. Sutherland
      shuddered, for as she coughed, and spat he saw on her lips a thin tinge of
      crimson blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had her well cared for that night, and the next day he called with a
      physician, and found her in bed, wild and ghastly, as if she had not got
      long to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! monsieur, forgive me!&rsquo; she cried, with a sad smile, reaching out her
      wasted hand. &lsquo;I was <i>méchante</i> last night, but to see that man made
      me mad. I think I should have killed him had I been able. I was good and
      <i>gentille</i> when he first knew me, and he coaxed me away from my
      friends and took me to that evil place where you found me. But for him I
      might have been a good woman&mdash;you comprehend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak of it now. This gentleman is a doctor, I have brought him to
      see you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All, monsieur, how good you are!&rsquo; sobbed the girl, with a look of
      ineffable gratitude; and she raised his hand to her feverish lips and
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Edgar Sutherland was not the man to do any good deed by halves. Thanks to
      his generosity, Adèle Lambert was removed to a better lodging, and
      comfortably nursed; the doctor&rsquo;s opinion being that the disease, though
      certainly mortal, would progress slowly, and that much might be done to
      alleviate her distressing condition. Not content with assisting her with
      money, the young man visited her almost daily, and did his best to lighten
      her miserable lot; talked to her cheerfully, read to her; and without
      obtruding any moral or religious sentiment, contrived to turn her
      bewildered and despairing thoughts in the direction of some heavenly
      compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of these kindly visits he learned the whole story of the
      unfortunate girl&rsquo;s connection with the French adventurer, whom he had
      again recognised. That story cannot be told here; it would be too shocking
      for a society that hushes up revolting truths, and bases its moral
      security on the existence of an evil which philosophers contemplate with
      tranquillity, and men of the world with pleasant cynicism. Not even in the
      pages of a fiction with a purpose can an English writer print the record
      of what is at the best an accursed human sacrifice, a trade to which the
      slave trade was venial; a social abomination which destroys the body and
      too often obliterates the germinating soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know well how, in discussing this question, philosophy and
      sentimentalism are at issue; how statistics have been twisted to show that
      actual seduction is rare, and rarest upon the man&rsquo;s side; how the majority
      of the lost live happily, healthily, and long; how their existence is a
      necessity of civilisation, the security of virtue, the protection of the
      household, the safeguard of the morals of the State. Well, I say with
      Sutherland, God help our civilisation if this be so! So long as such a
      canker exists, so long as the moral holocaust continues, there is no hope
      for any living woman, and the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth, which poets
      have dreamed of, is whole eternities away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;AT THE COUNTESS AURELIA&rsquo;S.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nce or twice
      during the season it was the custom of the Countess Aurelia Van Homrigh to
      give a literary party. This party had at first been but a small social
      gathering, invitations being issued only to a few of the most select of
      the lady&rsquo;s literary and scientific friends, but every year the invitations
      had grown more numerous, until the yearly reunions became quite the mode,
      and each one was an event to which the world of art, science, and letters
      looked forward with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess was a pretty little Englishwoman, married to a foreign
      adventurer, who had made an enormous fortune in certain obscure branches
      of trade. While yet a maiden Miss Aurelia Blackeston was well known in
      aesthetic circles as the writer of many charming volumes of verse, and as
      the favoured lady to whom a certain great and titled poet addressed the
      lines commencing
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;Aurelia, pretty one, brightest of blues!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As a wife and a lady of title the same lady doubled her social charms. Her
      husband, standing quietly in her shadow, watched her with morose
      adoration, whilst she dispensed hospitality to all the lions of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Aurelia loved a lion, just as some people love a lord. On each
      occasion there were new ones to be sought out, secured and made much of,
      before the party could be complete. In difficulties of this sort she
      generally appealed to her old friend and admirer Serena, who, being
      full-manned and leonine himself, was a good judge of the noble animal in
      demand. Serena, we may remark <i>en passant</i>, had painted the Countess
      in every attitude and from every conceivable point of view; as a
      Pythoness, as a &lsquo;Psyche by the Waters of Love&rsquo;s Wanness,&rsquo; as &lsquo;A Study in
      Rose Pink,&rsquo; as &lsquo;Vivien the Enchantress,&rsquo; in which doleful composition the
      painter himself appeared as Merlin; and most of these portraits adorned
      the walls of the cerulean house at Barnes, on the banks of the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, early in the season, Madeline, sitting at breakfast with her
      husband, received the Countess&rsquo;s invitation; accompanying it was a little
      note from Serena. &lsquo;I hope you will come; indeed, you must come,&rsquo; wrote the
      great man, &lsquo;since on this occasion the fair Aurelia&rsquo;s rooms will be graced
      by the presence of a gentleman whom I wish particularly to make known to
      you, a charming creature whose soul is redolent of music and divine song.
      He comes to my rooms, he contemplates your picture by the hour&mdash;he
      vows that so divine a creature cannot exist. I wish to show him that she
      does exist, and that, in trying to place it upon canvas, my poor hand has
      signally failed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline read the letter with a smile, then she handed it to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Countess is not content with mere lions this year,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;She
      evidently intends to make a lioness of <i>me</i>. Shall we go?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, we had better go, my dear,&rsquo; returned Forster quietly. &lsquo;Beneath all
      her humbug the Countess is an excellent person; she would be really pained
      if we stayed away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So without more ado&mdash;without more thought&mdash;the step was taken
      which was to become the great turning point in Madeline&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, Forster went to the City, while Madeline wrote a little
      note accepting the lady&rsquo;s invitation; then put the whole matter from her
      mind, ordered her carriage, and an hour later was driving down Regent
      Street, with the little boy who was now her constant companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life into which Madeline had entered on her marriage had proved so far
      to be a happy one. James Forster, always kind and considerate, was devoted
      to his young wife; while Madeline tried to repay some of his kindness to
      her by lavishing her affection on his child. &lsquo;He shall never repent
      marrying me,&rsquo; she said to herself a hundred times a day. &lsquo;He alone knows I
      did not bring him honour, but I will bring him happiness.&rsquo; And she tried
      to keep her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the days flew past, and at length the momentous one arrived on
      which Mr. and Mrs. Forster were to appear at the Countess&rsquo;s house at
      Barnes. Forster went to the City as usual, but promised to return early;
      he was detained, however, so that when he reached home he found his wife
      already arrayed for the night. He looked at her, then gently kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, my dear,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I never saw you look more lovely&rsquo;: then he
      added quietly&mdash;&lsquo;Should you mind very much, my love, if I stayed at
      home to-night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stayed at home?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have had one of my nervous headaches all day, and I don&rsquo;t feel
      equal to facing the Countess&rsquo;s crowded rooms.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you shall remain at home, and I will remain with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so, my love: you must go, and Margaret shall accompany you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I would rather stay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, Madeline. If you talk like that I shall go, and punish you for
      your perversity by being more than usually disagreeable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was settled, the carriage was ordered, and Madeline drove down to
      Barnes with Miss Forster by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gathering, as we have said, was always numerous, but this time it
      seemed of greater importance than ever. The street on the river side was
      so blocked with carriages that some time elapsed before Forster&rsquo;s brougham
      could pull up at the door, and when at length it did, and the ladies
      passed over the carpeted pavement into the hall, they found themselves in
      so dense a throng that it was with difficulty they made their way along at
      all. At length, however, they reached the top of the crowded staircase, at
      the door of a crowded room. Here Madeline paused; her eyes, lately
      accustomed to the darkness, were dazzled by the brilliant glare of light
      which met them, so that at first she could find out nothing very
      distinctly; in a moment, however, the feeling of confusion passed away,
      and with one swift glance she took in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a suite of lofty rooms running from one to another, like a picture
      gallery, and almost as thickly covered with works of art, were ladies and
      gentlemen of all shapes and ages, the majority of the ladies clad in what
      is now known as the aesthetic, or high-waisted, style, and the greater
      number of the gentlemen resembling one another in a certain limp and
      flaccid self-consciousness of attitude. Scattered here and there, as a
      sort of leaven, were swarthy artists, with beards, spectacled <i>savants</i>
      and scientists, stout literary ladies, and acidulous lady members of the
      London School Board. It was, indeed, a scene too familiar to need much
      describing. The chatter was deafening, reminding an irreverent spectator
      of the noise in the monkey-house at the Zoological Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Madeline and Miss Forster stood hesitating within the threshold of
      the room, they were espied from a distance by Serena, who immediately made
      his way over to them, and forthwith, in the manner of one having
      authority, led them to the lady of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess, who was shining resplendent in a dress composed entirely of
      Indian shawls folded tight round her lissome figure, welcomed Madeline
      with effusion, and gave the tip of her fingers to Miss Forster; then after
      a little desultory prattle, she introduced Madeline to a limp gentleman
      standing near, and floated away to another part of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A charming creature the Countess,&rsquo; said the limp gentleman. &lsquo;So far above
      the vulgar prejudices of our too crowded civilisation, with no creed but
      Beauty, and no God but Art.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; murmured Madeline, scarcely attending, as she gazed rather vacantly
      round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you seen Botticelli Jones&rsquo;s picture of her ladyship as &ldquo;A Lily of
      Languor in the Garden of Proserpine&rdquo;? No? Well, Ponto says it is the most
      superbly sane and cosmic thing&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a cry from Madeline, who, leaving his side without a
      word of apology, crossed the room rapidly, and approached a grim-looking
      person with a light beard, clad in a very shabby dress suit and rather
      disreputable boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no other person than Jack Bingham, an artist by profession, of
      the old &lsquo;pipe and beer&rsquo; school, and a bosom friend of Marmaduke White.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, Jack!&rsquo; she cried, holding out both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody called him Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke the grim face relaxed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, is it you?&rsquo; returned Jack, with a delighted laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and I am so glad to see you. But who would have thought of meeting
      you here, of all the places in the world? Dear, dear Jack, the very sight
      of you calls up old times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And tears stood in her eyes as she gazed upon his homely face. Jack was
      affected too in his rough way, so he made a diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beastly slow, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a smoke room,
      and none of the fellows are my sort.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you come to see me?&rsquo; asked Madeline, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since your marriage?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;and your husband&rsquo;s a
      swell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s nothing of the sort, Jack, and as to not being asked, you ought to
      have known my house was open to every friend of my dear guardian. You
      might smoke in the drawing-room if you liked, and no one would object.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite such a beast as that; but there, I&rsquo;ll come since you wish
      it, and have a talk about old times.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point they were interrupted by Blanco Serena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Forster,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;permit me; I wish to make two clever people
      known to each other.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline placed her hand on Serena&rsquo;s proffered arm, and with a smile and a
      nod to Bingham moved a few steps away. Presently she paused and looked up
      into her companion&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serena,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;who is the person? Nobody very clever, I hope; I
      am so afraid of very clever people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going, my dear Imogen, to introduce you to one who, if the
      &ldquo;Megatherium&rdquo; is to be trusted, is one of the greatest minds of the age. A
      man who is all spirit, whose soul is a combination of music and song,
      whose&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; broke in Madeline, &lsquo;he must be a dreadful person. Suppose you
      point him out to me before we meet him, in case I get quite overcome.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena gazed round the room. The crowd was so great he could not at first
      find the individual he sought, and with Madeline&rsquo;s hand still upon his arm
      he moved a few more steps forward. Suddenly he paused again, gazed across
      the room, and Madeline, following the gaze with her eyes, beheld a form
      the first sight of which chilled her to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was long and vast, and the further end of it curved off into a
      kind of alcove, which at this moment was filled with an admiring group,
      such as Du Maurier loves to draw&mdash;aesthetic ladies, for the most part
      tall and limp, and lean gentlemen, crowded together, who stood gazing in
      rapt admiration upon a figure who stood in their midst. It was upon this
      figure that Madeline&rsquo;s eyes had fallen. In this wonderful creature, this
      new lion of the night, she recognised, with a sickening shock of surprise,
      none other than her old friend and tormentor, Belleisle!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment all power of speech deserted her, the room, the crowds,
      melted away&mdash;she stood as if alone, gazing upon the figure of a man
      in overwhelming fear&mdash;all the blood had deserted her cheeks, the hand
      which lay upon her companion&rsquo;s arm was cold and death-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was recalled to herself by the sound of Serena&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Forster,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will you come on now&mdash;may I be permitted
      the honour of presenting you to my friend Gavrolles?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madeline neither moved nor spoke. Her companion turned towards her,
      and noticed the ghastly hue of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;What has happened? My dear Mrs. Forster,
      let me trust you are not ill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline clutched nervously at his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, not so loud,&rsquo; she whispered; then forcing a faint smile to her
      bloodless lips, she murmured, &lsquo;I am not feeling well, Mr. Serena, but
      indeed there is no cause for alarm. The rooms are hot, you see, and I have
      grown a little faint. Pray let me sit for a moment, but take no further
      notice of this, I beseech you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly bewildered as to what it all meant, but feeling instinctively that
      something wrong had happened, Serena did as he was requested. He led
      Madeline to an ottoman; she sank down on it with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now let me fetch you a glass of wine, or something to take away the
      faintness,&rsquo; he said anxiously; and Madeline bowed her head in silent
      acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had gone she turned her weary, bewildered eyes upon the gay
      crowd surrounding her, and gazed again with a sickening sense of shrinking
      fear towards the spot where the man had stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had her eyes deceived her, had it been some hideous vision conjured up to
      cast a black shadow upon the happiness which was hers at last? Madeline
      turned her eyes, hoping, half believing this might be so; but one look
      gave the death-blow to all her hopes, and made her terror more terrible
      than it had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there he stood, the man who had blighted her young life, who had
      dragged her into the mud, from which, in spite of him, she had arisen. He
      was changed, certainly, but what changes could disguise him? His hair,
      once short, was now long and luxuriant, he was clothed in garments of the
      newest cut, he was talking rapidly, twisting his body into various
      contortions, for the benefit of the small crowd about him. There was no
      mistaking those pitiless eyes, that cruel mouth. Yes, it was Belleisle,
      the man who had cheated her into becoming his mistress, who had made her
      the decoy of a gambling hell, who had dragged her into the very depths of
      dishonour and pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for a time concealing her face with her fan, but gazing upon him
      in a wild fascination; then a terror seized her that the dreadful figure
      might approach and she would be recognised. The mere possibility sent a
      cold thrill through all her frame, and she realised for the first time all
      the evil which one word from the man&rsquo;s lips could bring upon her head.
      Serena returned with a glass of wine and a biscuit. She sipped the wine,
      but put the biscuit from her. Then she turned her white face towards
      Serena, and whispered eagerly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serena, I must go home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go home! My dear Mrs. Forster, the evening has hardly begun. We cannot
      lose one of our brightest ornaments&mdash;besides, I have yet to introduce
      you to&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; interrupted Madeline, eagerly, &lsquo;do, pray, let me go. Take me
      downstairs, I can bear this place no longer. I will wait in the hall for
      the carriage, and you can bring Miss Forster to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and without giving Serena time to reply, she rose, took his
      arm, and drew him out of the crowded room, down the stairs. Once clear of
      the room she seemed to breathe more freely, but her cheek still retained
      its ashen grey hue, and the hand which rested upon his arm trembled
      violently. He led her to the hall, wrapped her cloak about her, and
      ordered her carriage; then, at her request, he returned to the room to
      fetch Miss Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yet early, carriages continued to drive up to the door, and new
      streams of people made their way into the dwelling, but in the confusion
      no one noticed Madeline. She had withdrawn into the shadow, and stood now
      tremulous with excitement and eager to be gone, and inwardly thanking God
      that she had escaped the Frenchman&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt herself lightly touched upon the arm. She turned
      quickly, and found herself face to face with the very man she feared!
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly she shrank away, and a quick cry of pain escaped her lips. She
      put her hand to her head in a wild bewildered fear, and stared stupidly at
      her foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman was by no means disconcerted. He bowed politely before her,
      asked in an audible voice if he could be of any service to her, but
      whispered low&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must see you alone to-morrow. Name a place where we shall meet!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline did not utter a cry this time, but she shrank farther and farther
      away. Then she raised her head and looked straight into the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      eyes. For a moment she had been seized with a mad idea to disown any
      knowledge of him&mdash;that one look into his eyes convinced her that the
      device was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Name a time and place,&rsquo; he repeated. Madeline knew that to refuse was
      impossible&mdash;so she said hurriedly&mdash;&lsquo;Albert Memorial to-morrow
      morning at 11.&rsquo; Then she gazed like a frightened child about her, and saw
      with dismay that Miss Forster stood close at hand. Had she heard or seen?
      Madeline could not tell, for the lady&rsquo;s face betrayed nothing. She came
      quickly forward, and said, in her cold, unsympathetic voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter, Madeline?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline&rsquo;s face, which had lately been so pale, suddenly became crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stammered out that nothing was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Serena told me that you had been ill.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not feel well,&rsquo; returned Madeline, regaining some of her
      self-command, &lsquo;and I should like to go home&mdash;but, dear Miss Forster,
      if you will permit me I will go alone. It seems a pity to take you away so
      soon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady replied, coldly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no wish to stay. I came because my brother wished me to come; that
      was all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Serena, who had been busy hurrying up the carriage, came to
      announce that it was ready, to offer his arm to the ladies, and once more
      to express his deep grief at Madeline&rsquo;s untimely departure. Madeline took
      his arm in silence. As she moved away, she turned and gazed uneasily
      around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive home was made in profound silence. Miss Forster sat in stately
      reticence and gazed from the carriage window at the flashing lamps of the
      street, while Madeline threw herself into her corner, closed her weary
      eyes, and tried to persuade herself that the event of the last hour had
      been but a dream. She was a little bewildered as yet, and unable to
      realise all that the man&rsquo;s presence might mean. To her as yet he had only
      recalled the horror of her past-life; he had cast no actual shadow over
      her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage was pulled up at the door and she stepped out, she felt
      herself shivering from head to foot, though in reality her hands and lips
      were burning. When she pleaded illness as the cause of her early return,
      Forster readily believed her, and while folding her in his arms he blamed
      his own folly for allowing her to go forth at all that night. Was it his
      fancy, or did Madeline really shrink from his embrace; yes, shrink from
      it, as she had never done before? He turned anxiously towards her, he
      noticed that her cheek was flushed, and that a strange light shone in her
      eyes; but he saw no mystery there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having satisfactorily explained her return, Madeline went at once to her
      room, where she found her maid awaiting her. The girl assisted her
      mistress to remove her dress; to take down her hair, and put on her
      dressing gown; then she was summarily dismissed for the night, and
      Madeline, after locking her door, sat down to think what it would be best
      for her to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she done? Nothing as yet. She had let the man see that she feared
      him, certainly, but then he needed no sign from her to assure him of that.
      She had, moreover, in her desperation and fear of exposure, made an
      assignation with him. But then that assignation need never be kept. There
      was one way open to her&mdash;one open, honest course; but she shrank from
      it appalled. Her heart counselled thus&mdash;&lsquo;Go to your husband, tell him
      all, and throw yourself upon his sympathy;&rsquo; but her courage failed her,
      she shrank back like a contaminated guilty thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to him, look in his eyes, and say to him&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen to-night
      the man who made me his mistress; with one word he can bring disgrace upon
      me, and <i>you</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she could not do it. Whatever her husband had heard of her past she
      hoped by this time he had forgotten. In Forster&rsquo;s sight, at least, she
      would not be degraded; come what might, she would fight her battle alone.

      CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;GAVROLLES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Madeline came
      down to breakfast next morning she looked very ill. There was a wild light
      in her eyes and a feverish flush upon her face. Quite unsuspicious of the
      real cause of the change in her, Forster attributed it to the
      indisposition of the night before, and began to wonder if the sudden
      change in her habits was going to tell upon her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was a great change to be transported from the wild excitement
      of public life to the monotonous existence of a quiet house like his; but
      when he had asked her to give up the stage, he had thought he was lifting
      from her shoulders a load of which she would gladly be free. He had wished
      his wife to take her ease and enjoy her days, not to toil wearily as if
      for her daily bread. But now he began to think that he had been totally
      wrong. While he had been working away with unconscious happiness in the
      City, his beautiful wild bird had been beating her breast against the bars
      of her gilded cage, and pining for that freedom which to all gifted beings
      is so dear. These thoughts and many more of the same strain passed through
      Forster&rsquo;s mind, while he made his way to the City. Long before he reached
      his office he had decided how to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will speak to Madeline to-night,&rsquo; he said to himself, and hear her
      views. Something must be done to make her contented.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Madeline, left with Miss Forster, walked about the room in new
      restlessness. She looked out of the window; it was a damp, dark day; she
      looked at her watch, it was past ten o&rsquo;clock. In an hour she had promised
      to meet the man, and by this time she had settled in her mind that she
      must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he could want with her she could not tell, and she had not paused to
      inquire. That he meant her no good she knew, but it was useless to
      anticipate the evil, till she knew its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs with a heavy heart, and returned, greatly to Miss
      Forster&rsquo;s surprise, in walking costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy, confident of his reception, came bounding in and clung
      affectionately to her skirts. She kissed him fondly, but told him he could
      not go with her that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all? May I not go a little way, mamma?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even a little way, darling; I must go alone to-day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such a strange ring in her voice that Miss Forster looked up in
      some amazement, while the child clung closer to Madeline, and ardently
      kissed the cold, pale cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma is going to see a doctor,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;is it not so, mamma?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then where are you going alone, on such a cold wet day?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline flushed uneasily, and impatiently put the child from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should not ask so many questions,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it is rude!&rsquo; Then,
      noting the little crestfallen face, she hurriedly caught him up again and
      kissed him, while her own eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, do not mind, I was wrong; but I did not mean to pain you, darling&mdash;no,
      no&mdash;not <i>you!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During the enacting of this scene Miss Forster had still remained in the
      room. Up to this moment she had said nothing; but her eyes had followed
      all her sister-in-law&rsquo;s movements, and watched her face with peculiar
      interest. When Madeline had put down the boy, and was about to leave the
      room, she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The carriage has not come round,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline started, and turned. She had ignored the presence of her
      sister-in-law; and that lady noticed that the sudden recollection of it
      brought another uncomfortable flush to the pale cheek, and caused another
      anxious look about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I have not ordered the carriage,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No question had been asked, therefore Madeline was not bound to reply; but
      feeling that she must say something, she stammered rather awkwardly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to walk. I prefer it to-day, as my head is bad, but I shall
      not be long away.&rsquo; Then, as if in dread of further questioning, she
      hurried from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly a most inclement morning, but Madeline, being suitably
      clad, did not heed the weather. After walking a short distance, she hailed
      a passing hansom and drove to the park gate, close to the Albert Memorial;
      here she alighted, and crossing to the footpath sank wearily upon one of
      the seats to watch for the Frenchman&rsquo;s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not sat long when she saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous to her coming, Gavrolles, as we must continue to call him, had
      been parading theatrically round the memorial for a quarter of an hour, to
      the great admiration of several idle nursemaids. He did not at first see
      Madeline. He was smoking a cigar, glancing with careless interest at the
      somewhat tawdry designs, and keeping a cat-like eye on the figures which
      were moving about the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another turn round the monument; then his eye fell upon Madeline, who
      still retained her seat close by. In a moment the whole man seemed to
      change. He smiled, tossed away his cigar, and advanced gallantly towards
      her. He raised his hat, then cordially extended his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; he exclaimed in French; &lsquo;charmed to see you abroad so
      early! May I so far presume upon your friendship as to walk with you a
      very little way around the park?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline rose in silence, took no notice of his extended hand, and walked
      along by his side. She looked cold, haughty, and defiant; but in truth her
      heart was sinking terribly. As for Gavrolles, if he was a little
      disconcerted at first, he quickly regained his composure. As he drew back
      his rejected hand he smiled, and the smile seemed to say: &lsquo;It is your turn
      now, Madame! <i>Eh bien</i>, enjoy your pride to the full; my time is at
      hand, and I mean to take advantage of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> he exclaimed, &lsquo;how the place is deserted; and yet to my
      mind the morning is the pleasantest time of the day. See how fresh the
      flowers and the grass!&mdash;and the breeze is still sweet and cool with
      last night&rsquo;s dew! It seems to bring new life to a man. Ah, yes; it is
      charming!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He expanded his chest, he raised his hat to let the breeze play with his
      flowing locks of hair, then he gave a sidelong glance at Madeline, and met
      her eyes. She paused, and for the first time that day addressed him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot stay,&rsquo; she said quietly. &lsquo;Why have you forced me to meet you
      here to-day?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, he raised his hand in polite protestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forced you!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Ah, but you use hard words, my dear Madeline.
      I employ force to no one; certainly not to one so esteemed. If your memory
      is good, you must know that I merely asked an interview. You were gracious
      enough not only to grant it, but to name also our place of meeting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him steadily in the face, and her lip curled contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you oblige me by answering my question?&rsquo; Again he smiled, but while
      he did so his face was by no means pleasant to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will make my best endeavours, madame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First, tell me this: when you went to that house last night were you
      certain of meeting me there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I most certainly hoped to have the pleasure of meeting you. I have lived
      in this strange world long enough to know that nothing is certain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you know that I had married an honourable man?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew that; yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet you made up your mind to thrust yourself upon me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed profoundly. &lsquo;My dear Madeline, your penetration is wonderful. I
      perceive you are one of the few beings in this stupid world fully capable
      of understanding me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unfortunately for myself,&rsquo; Madeline continued, &lsquo;I understand you
      sufficiently to know that you would not plan this meeting if there was no
      purpose to be obtained by it. What new injury do you wish to do me <i>now?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her flushed face and muttered, &lsquo;<i>Ma foi</i>, but she is
      charming!&rsquo; Then he added, aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I merely wished to tell you, Madeline, something that you do not know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only this&mdash;that although you have married an honourable man, as you
      say, you are nevertheless still my wife.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;IN THE TOILS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e spoke quietly
      enough, but she recoiled as if he had struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your wife!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;<i>Your wife</i>, monsieur!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark look passed over the Frenchman&rsquo;s face. He bowed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is an honour which has been coveted by many, madame,&rsquo; he returned, &lsquo;to
      be the wife of your humble <i>serviteur</i>; but I am proud to say it has
      been reserved for one who is truly worthy of it. Yes, Madeline, I will own
      it&mdash;at one time I thought the position too elevated for you; but when
      I saw you nobly rising to fame, I said to myself, &ldquo;After all, I was wrong.
      She is a splendid creature; she will adorn our world of Art; at the right
      moment I will reveal the truth, and claim her&rdquo;&mdash;and so, my dear
      Madeline, I claim you <i>now!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, he held forth his hand; but Madeline recoiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not touch me,&rsquo; she cried wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Eh bien</i>&mdash;I have no wish to touch you, <i>chère amie</i>&mdash;but
      if you play the tragedy queen in the park you will gather a crowd about
      you, and that would not be pleasant for <i>you.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with quiet malignity; nevertheless Madeline knew that he spoke
      truly. She was utterly in his power, and for her own sake she dared not
      make a scene; whatever she said must be said quietly for fear of
      attracting attention. She cast a fearful glance around her, then, pale and
      trembling with disgust and shame, she turned again to the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is another of your falsehoods. Why have you chosen to tell me it
      to-day?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what a question! I do not choose to tell you a story. I
      came to claim my wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is false. I am not your wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No? Then this little writing lies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he drew forth a paper and waved it carelessly in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear Madeline, there was once a time when you would joyfully have
      received the news I bring you to-day. You did not always scorn the thought
      of being madame my lady!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right, monsieur,&rsquo; answered Madeline. &lsquo;There was once a time when
      the news which you bring me today would have been welcome to me, but thank
      God that time has gone, and I am changed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he returned quietly, &lsquo;you are changed, as you say; so also am I. At
      that period of my career to which you allude I was not perfect, and,
      pardon me for saying so, Madeline, neither were you. I confess with all
      humility that I told lies, and we both showed temper, but&mdash;<i>nous
      avons changé tout cela!</i> I come to-day to tell you the truth, and to
      offer you your rightful home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he moved as if to approach her. Again she shrank away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not the truth,&rsquo; she returned vehemently; &lsquo;I refuse to believe you!
      You told me the truth once, but you are lying to me to-day!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his face darkened, but when he spoke his voice was as sweet as it
      had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your judgment is harsh, <i>chérie</i>, but I have without doubt deserved
      it&mdash;that being so, I bear it with patience. I say to you that I lied
      to you before; therefore I must not expect you to believe me now. Before I
      could not prove the truth of my statement, but that is all changed at
      last!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he produced his slip of paper; this time he held it out before
      Madeline&rsquo;s eyes. In a dazed, troubled way she looked at it. She saw at a
      glance that it was the certificate, real or forged, of the marriage
      between Auguste Belleisle and Madeline Hazel mere. Therefore she
      completely lost her self control, and did what, under the circumstances,
      it was most injudicious that she should do&mdash;she allowed the Frenchman
      to see that she was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not&mdash;I cannot&mdash;believe it,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;If it is so, why
      did you tell me that wicked falsehood, when I did not know you well enough
      to doubt your word?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell you, dearest. When I induced you to fly with me from the
      school I was poor&mdash;miserably poor, and I believed I was eloping with
      a lady who would become possessed of a fortune when she was of age. Ah!
      forgive me, but I was wicked, corrupt! Then I said to myself, &ldquo;She is a
      charming girl; she will become the victim of fortune-hunters; she
      evidently adores me, and I care for her; the fortune must be mine!&rdquo;
       Afterwards you repented of your mad folly. I knew you did so too late&mdash;in
      spite of your wishes I married you. Shortly after our marriage you
      yourself informed me, <i>chérie</i>, that you were poor. I felt that I had
      been befooled, and I grew enraged. Still, as I could not easily rid myself
      of my wife, I resolved to make her useful. I did so. You fell into my
      plans until you discovered them; then you showed temper, and threatened to
      become dangerous. I wondered for a second time what I should do with you.
      I determined to try a bold stroke, and succeed or fail. I succeeded. I
      told you a lie, <i>mon ange</i>, and in your charming innocence you
      believed it to be the truth. You asked for no proofs, which was lucky for
      me, since I could produce none. You believed that you had been my
      mistress. I knew that you were bound to me by a nearer and a dearer tie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked at her. Her face was ghastly, her eyes wildly fixed;
      she shivered through all her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame, you are not well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she shrank away. He smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Mon ange</i>, I know I have done wrong, but you must forget and
      forgive. I came to make amends. Since those days of which I have spoken I
      also have changed. I am no longer a penniless, nameless Frenchman. I have
      risen to a position which henceforth I hope to adorn. The divine Muse has
      entered into my soul. Art is now my adored mistress; the great men and
      women of the land are pleased, so to speak, to prostrate themselves before
      me. I offer you a position which thousands would give their lives to fill.
      <i>Bien!</i> I care nothing for them. I accept their adulation, but I am
      willing to place you beside me and say to the world, &ldquo;This charming
      creature is my wife!&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What wonderful self-sacrifice!&mdash;what condescension!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood as if expecting her to fall in ecstasy at his feet. She simply
      stared at him in dumb amazement, till, disgusted at her silence,
      Gavrolles, who had all his wits about him, spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but am I not generous!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I say to you, &ldquo;Come to
      me, my wife;&rdquo; while you think, &ldquo;Alas! it is too late. I have taken to
      myself another husband.&rdquo; Well, that shall make no difference to me. I take
      the blame of that, since it was I who deceived you. Yes, <i>mon ange</i>,
      I forgive you from my soul! *
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in deepening horror, while she said in a hollow voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of my husband, monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, I had no thought of him. What is he?&mdash;a common
      tradesman, I believe; a dull creature, incapable of comprehending the
      splendours of a nature like mine; there is no poetry in his soul. He adds
      up his accounts now; he will add them up when you are gone&mdash;that is
      all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline&rsquo;s face grew even whiter, but her eyes flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;take care. Say what you like of me, do what you
      can to me, but don&rsquo;t dare to put a slight on <i>him</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the Frenchman&rsquo;s turn to be astonished. For a moment the
      lackadaisical look of condescension passed completely from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only this, monsieur, that the gentleman whom you are pleased to denounce
      as commonplace is as far above you as the sun is above the earth. That
      after you had tried to destroy me it was he who nobly put out his hand to
      save me. That sooner than let you bring disgrace and sorrow to him I will
      make a sacrifice of myself, perhaps of you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, but you are heroic,&rsquo; sneered the Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I am,&rsquo; continued Madeline, &lsquo;I am; thanks to you, and you only. I
      have been dragged as low almost as the women who nightly walk the streets.
      Now you come to me and ask me to return to shame and degradation. Your
      wife I may be, as you say, but sooner than return to you and live with you&mdash;in
      honourable wedlock, as the world would call it&mdash;I would destroy
      myself. I expect no mercy from you. Well, you may do you worst&mdash;what
      that may be I neither know nor care.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And before the Frenchman could utter a word she turned from him and walked
      swiftly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not attempt to follow her. This sudden and unexpected onslaught of
      his victim had found him quite unprepared, and he gazed after her with
      eyes full of perplexity and amazement. Then he, too, turned and walked
      away. He strolled slowly through the park in the direction of the
      Serpentine; having reached it, he paused on one of the bridges, leant over
      the parapet, and watched the swans. He felt in his pocket, threw them some
      broken biscuits, and watched them eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While so watching, he soliloquised. &lsquo;As I suspected,&rsquo; he murmured, &lsquo;she
      still possesses a spirit and a temper&mdash;-<i>eh bien</i>, it is for me
      to manage both. If this little piece of paper (touching the certificate)
      were genuine, if that spirited creature were indeed my wife, I should find
      my work easy. The law would give her to me, and there would be an end to
      the whole matter. I would place her again upon the stage; she would make
      me a rich man, while I could pursue my dream, mount rapidly up the ladder
      of fame, become the idol of mankind, and make my name immortal. But, alas!
      that cannot be. The charming creature detests me, and means to resist me.
      I dare not appeal to the law, for it would require more proofs of my
      sagacity than my charming Madeline does. <i>Parbleu!</i> what must I do <i>now?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran his thin fingers through his long hair; he gazed again meditatively
      at the water; he threw some more biscuits to the swans. Suddenly the
      perplexed look passed away from his face, which lit up into positive
      ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The husband! 5 he cried. &lsquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> but she adores the husband
      even more cordially than she detests me. Let me think of him; let my plans
      involve him, and my success is tolerably sure.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;IN THE ROW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Gavrolles, in
      a grotesque attitude, was soliloquising and feeding the swans, Madeline
      was walking along the pavement of the principal street in Knightsbridge.
      Her eyes rested upon the gaily decked shop windows and the busy crowd
      about her, but her thoughts were still with the man whom she had just
      left. Already she repented of her madness in having defied him. Once or
      twice she paused with the intention of returning to him and asking for
      pity, but her resolutions were no sooner made than conquered; to expect
      mercy from that man was like looking for water to flow from a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused and looked blankly in at a shop window; as she did so she felt
      herself touched lightly and timidly on the arm; and on looking down she
      found that she had been accosted by a flower girl; a pale, little
      creature, clad in miserable rags, with a face pinched and pallid from
      starvation, who timidly held forth a bunch of half-withered violets.
      Madeline looked down, and her eyes filled with tears; not with sorrow for
      the child&mdash;they were tears of self-pity&mdash;for as she pressed some
      silver into the child&rsquo;s hand, she thought, &lsquo;What would I give to change
      places with you to-day?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus recalled to herself, she looked at her watch. It was one o&rsquo;clock; at
      two she knew that Miss Forster would expect her to preside at the luncheon
      table. She determined to hurry home, in order to have a few minutes to
      compose herself before she was compelled to meet her sister-in-law. She
      called a hansom, and ordered the man to drive to her house. She stopped
      him at the street corner, however, and finished her journey on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her intense relief she was able to gain her room without encountering
      the lady whose presence seemed to inspire her with so much dread. Having
      reached the room she shut herself in, sank down on an ottoman, and stared
      despairingly before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His wife!&rsquo; Could it be that he had spoken truly, that she was really
      bound by the sacred tie to the man who had done his best to ruin her?
      Could it be that she had brought shame and disgrace on the man who had
      been noble enough to shut out the past and to cleanse and purify her with
      his unstained name? &lsquo;My God,&rsquo; she murmured, I think I am accursed. I am
      like a leper&mdash;a vile, unclean thing which contaminates all it
      touches. I did sin, in a wild, impulsive, girlish way, but why should that
      sin for ever drag me down? I have repented&mdash;I have tried to atone&mdash;but
      for me there seems no mercy.&rsquo; Then came the question, What must she do?
      Return to Monsieur Belleisle, whom the world would doubtless call her
      lawful husband? Live with him in degradation as great as any she had yet
      been made to bear?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I would sooner, as I said to him, destroy my miserable
      life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle tap at the door aroused her. She opened it and admitted her
      little step-son. It was a custom of the child to call at Madeline&rsquo;s room,
      and if he found her go down with her to lunch. He bounded in in his usual
      light-hearted way, but on seeing her face his hilarity received a check.
      He took her hand and kissed it, he looked up wistfully into her eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma&rsquo;s headache is no better,&rsquo; he said quietly, &lsquo;Why do you think that,
      darling?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&mdash;because you are so white&mdash;and because your eyes are all
      wet. Why have you been crying, mamma; what is there to make you cry?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what indeed?&rsquo; echoed Madeline, seizing up the child and clasping him
      passionately in her arms. &lsquo;But, remember, my pet, I spoke roughly to you
      this morning&mdash;I have been away from you for hours; perhaps I thought
      you would not be glad to see me back again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, no! you would not think that,&rsquo; he said, pressing his rosy cheek
      against her cold, pale face. &lsquo;What would papa do? What should we all do if
      mamma went away?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, but held the child closely to her as she descended to the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was got through in oppressive silence. To be sure, the presence
      of the servants acted as a barrier to anything like conversation; but
      every one felt on this occasion that there was something more. Even the
      child and the very servants seemed oppressed by that indescribable gloom
      which all felt but none could understand. The luncheon over, Madeline rose
      with a sigh of infinite relief, and ordered the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had ceased to fall, but the sky still looked threatening, and the
      drive did not prove to be a pleasant one. Still it seemed to Madeline that
      anything would be better than sitting in the house all the afternoon
      tormented by her own wretched thoughts. Presently, however, as she was
      putting on her hat, the thought occurred to her that it might be well for
      her to seek another interview with Belleisle. When, therefore, she
      descended the stairs she merely kissed the child, who was standing half
      expecting to be invited to go, and entered the carriage alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove straight to Regent Street, made one or two trifling purchases,
      then she ordered her coachman to take a few turns round the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season was rapidly drawing to a close; many families had already
      betaken themselves to the country, and most of those who lingered were
      busily preparing to go. Still, in spite of this, there were still enough
      people left to make a tolerable show in the Row, and Madeline had not been
      ten minutes in the drive before she was greeted with many gracious smiles
      and bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, her heart gave a great throb, then seemed to stand
      still, for her eyes rested upon the very form she sought. Could it be
      possible? Yes, there he was on horseback, on a sorry hack sicklied o&rsquo;er
      with the shade of the livery stable, and accompanied by two young ladies
      in green riding-habits and hats composed of peacocks&rsquo; feathers. The three
      horses were walking, and the three riders seemed heedless of everything
      but each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great and cosmic creature was holding forth, while the two girls were
      gazing upon him in rapt devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline felt her cheek grow crimson, for it seemed to her as if every
      soul about her suddenly read her secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward to speak to her coachman, and met the Frenchman&rsquo;s eye;
      his face became suddenly irradiated, he politely lifted his hat as the
      carriage passed him; but she felt herself utterly unable to make any sign
      in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day had passed wearily enough to James Forster. From the moment he
      had entered the office he had been able to think of nothing but his wife;
      so great was his anxiety and his eagerness to see her that he left
      business two hours before his usual time, and hurried home. It was not
      fair to her, he thought, that he should spend so many hours of the day
      away from her side. He pictured her at home, sitting disconsolately beside
      his lonely hearth. When he reached the house, however, he was
      disenchanted. He went up to the drawing-room and found his sister prim and
      neat as usual, working at some simple embroider work, and keeping an eye
      upon the child, who played at her feet. She looked surprised to see her
      brother at such an early hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has anything happened, James?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Margaret, have I grown such a methodical old fellow that you must
      imagine something has happened merely because I come home a couple of
      hours before dinner time? No, nothing has happened. I hurried home because
      I wanted to have a talk with Madeline. Where is she?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline is out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, she has been out all day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, where has she gone to?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, James, I am not Madeline&rsquo;s keeper. Since she didn&rsquo;t choose to
      tell me I thought it was not my duty to ask. I only know that she went out
      walking all the morning, and that immediately after lunch she went out
      driving. I have not seen her since.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I thought when she went out she generally took the boy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has always taken him before, but she did not want him to-day. She
      said it was necessary for her to go alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forster concluded with a significant &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; which spoke volumes.
      Forster made no reply; he turned away, went to his study, and sat there to
      await his wife&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour, two hours passed. She did not come. The first dinner bell rang&mdash;he
      rose to go to his room, and as he was crossing the hall he heard his
      wife&rsquo;s knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So late!&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;Where can she have been at this hour?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of his sister&rsquo;s peculiar manner when she had spoken to
      him, and instead of waiting to see his wife come in he went straight up to
      his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went down to dinner he found Madeline already at the table. Her
      face was paler than it had been on the preceding night, and there was the
      same strange, wild light in her eyes. Was it his fancy again, or did she
      really shrink from him when he put his arms around her and kissed her cold
      cheek? Why did she flush and look uneasily about the room when he asked
      her innocently enough what interesting appointment she could possibly have
      to keep her out all day? There was certainly something the matter which he
      was faintly conscious of, but which he could not possibly understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner over, Forster rose and asked his wife to go with him to his
      study. The request was a simple one, but Madeline started, her face grew
      paler than before, and a sickening sense of dread seized her heart. She
      filled a glass of water and drank off its contents; then with a courage
      born only of despair she went with him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;HUSBAND AND WIFE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>orster&rsquo;s study was
      the smallest room in the mansion, furnished very plainly but cosily, and
      shut off by two baize doors from the rest of the house. It contained,
      besides the ordinary furniture, a few favourite pictures in water-colour,
      and a small number of books, selected from the shelves of the library.
      Here Forster spent many a pleasant evening, following those studies in
      early English poetry and literature which were his chief recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The couple entered and seated themselves. Madeline had her eyes fixed
      thoughtfully on the fire, but she was fully conscious that her husband,
      leaning back in his writing chair, had his eyes intently upon her face.
      What could it mean? What was coming? She waited and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Madeline,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;I have been thinking about you all
      day long. That, of course, is nothing unusual, for I need not tell you
      that you are ever uppermost in my thoughts; but to-day I have been much
      troubled on your account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and looked at him. What did he mean? His face was curiously
      grave, and in his eyes there was the shadow of a great and wistful pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry you have been troubled,&rsquo; she said in a low sad voice, &lsquo;and
      that I have been the cause.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, my dear, it is no fault of yours; but the truth is I am very
      anxious. Sometimes of late&mdash;not always, but sometimes&mdash;I have
      thought that you are a little disappointed, a little weary. All my wish,
      all the dream of my life, is to see you happy; and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and passed his hand across his eyes; for tears were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not think I am unhappy,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I am not. I am happier than I
      deserve.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a dull house, I know,&rsquo; continued Forster, as if pursuing his own
      thoughts, &lsquo;and Margaret, I am afraid, a somewhat dull companion. It is not
      at all the life which you have been accustomed to, and I do not wonder
      that you find it dull. Well, how shall we brighten it?&rsquo; Here his face was
      lit by a loving smile. &lsquo;How shall I make my darling happy? I think I have
      discovered the way. Indeed, if I had not been a commonplace fool, I might
      have discovered it long before.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more puzzled than ever, she kept her eyes fixed upon his face; then
      seeing him smile so brightly, so kindly, she drew near to him and kissed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, my darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;you are so good to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not half so good as you deserve. Now listen&mdash;I have settled it. You
      shall return to the stage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But yes! Your divine gift shall not perish from want of use; you shall go
      back to the Art which you so love, and I&mdash;I shall be by, to rejoice
      in your happiness and your success.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of receiving the proposal with joy, as he had anticipated,
      Madeline rose, trembling and very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not decide hastily,&rsquo; said Forster, gently, &lsquo;but think it well over.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is quite unnecessary&mdash;I shall never act again; never! never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have disgraced you enough already.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disgraced me&mdash;God forbid! Madeline, you are my pride, my treasure&mdash;only
      honour can come to me through you. Don&rsquo;t think I am such a Philistine as
      to underrate your gifts, or the art you delight to follow. When I
      persuaded you to adopt this quiet life, I thought it might be better for
      your peace of mind, for your health. I see that I was wrong. Genius like
      yours cannot be contented with the mere humdrum of an English home. I was
      selfish, dear. You shall be my Imogen again, and, as I said, I will share
      your happy triumphs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is impossible,&rsquo; cried Madeline, impetuously. &lsquo;I hate the stage. Rather
      than return to it I would die.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Forster&rsquo;s turn to be amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hate the stage!&rsquo; he echoed. &lsquo;Ah, you do not mean what you say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I do mean it. When I first acted it was for my guardian&rsquo;s sake&mdash;to
      make him happy, and, perhaps, rich. But I never loved the life, and now&mdash;I
      sicken at it. Oh, James!&rsquo; she continued, in deepening agitation, &lsquo;do not
      think me foolish or ungrateful. I am quite, quite happy here with you.
      Yes, when we are alone together, when we are away from the world and all
      its feverish tumult, I am more than happy&mdash;I am at peace. Don&rsquo;t think
      otherwise. You ask me to go back into the world; it is the world that
      makes me miserable. If we should go away together&mdash;far from London,
      far from the wicked city&mdash;to some green country place, where none
      could know us, none could care for us, then, I think, I should be at peace
      indeed.&rsquo; As she spoke, she threw herself into his arms, for he had risen
      as if to implore her to be calm, and laid her head upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are not unhappy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I cannot tell!&rsquo; she sobbed. &lsquo;I think it is my
      disposition&mdash;never quite contented, never restful. When I was a
      child, I was a trouble to those who loved me; and afterwards&mdash;afterwards
      everything seemed to go wrong with me. But oh! do not think that I am
      ungrateful&mdash;that I do not love you as you deserve. I do! I do! I do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she clung to him sobbing, she repeated her protestations again and
      again. He too was strongly moved, and tried in vain to calm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is like you to reproach yourself,&rsquo; he said tenderly. &lsquo;My loving,
      unselfish darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am selfish,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I am not good, like you, James. It would
      have been better, far better, if we had never met.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must say it. I bring sorrow to all that love me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have never brought sorrow to me. Only happiness, my dear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could believe that! But where another woman would have been
      contented, I have been ill at ease. I hate myself for it! I hate my life!
      But oh! I love you! You do not doubt it, dear?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I doubted it I should be a miserable man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever happened, you would still believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till my dying day. You have proved it,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I, James?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God knows you have. You are not like common women&mdash;you are greater
      and better, and it is your very affection which makes you reproach
      yourself. But let us speak again&mdash;calmly, seriously&mdash;of what I
      proposed. You want occupation&mdash;you want play for your noble powers;
      here, darling, you are like a bird in a golden cage. Let me persuade you
      to try your wings again, to end this dreary existence. I can easily
      arrange everything for your return to the profession.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head sadly. &lsquo;Never! never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I not told you? Because I prefer to remain alone with <i>you</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her still, suspecting that her determination was caused by
      solicitude on his account, or some secret fear of compromising him; but
      when he saw that she was firm he was pleased. In the secresy of his own
      mind he rather dreaded the step that he proposed; lest that step, if
      taken, might draw them further asunder, and in more than one way lead to
      misconstruction. He was far too little of a Philistine to despise the
      theatre, to undervalue a beautiful and much-neglected art; but he knew its
      decadence, and understood its baser ambitions. He preferred to keep the
      woman he loved to himself, to screen her from the contamination of
      mercenary speculators and the coarse admiration of the dregs of the public
      which unhappily fill our theatres. The excitements of the stage, he
      thought, were not beneficial to a nature so overwrought as that of his
      wife; its <i>morale</i> was not edifying, its literature not spiritually
      ennobling, its successes were evanescent, its rewards too often achieved
      by ignoble means. All this he thought, yet did not say, for he honestly
      set his wife&rsquo;s personal happiness above all considerations of prejudice;
      but when he heard her emphatic determination, a weight was taken from his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the interview ended, bringing the husband and wife more closely and
      tenderly together, but still leaving on the woman&rsquo;s heart the sense of a
      nameless dread, which she dared not utter, and which he, of course, did
      not understand.

      CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;OLD JOURNALISM&mdash;AND NEW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>alling at
      Sutherland&rsquo;s rooms one morning, Crieff found him surrounded by a number of
      unwieldy volumes, dirty and dingy enough to have been picked up, as indeed
      they had been, in the uncleanest shop in Holywell Street. One of these
      volumes he was examining with considerable impatience when Crieff entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you got there?&rsquo; asked the journalist, peeping over his
      shoulder. &lsquo;As I live, an old volume of the &ldquo;Satyrnine Review.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I saw the rubbish ticketed up very cheap, and bought it. It is not a
      complete set, but sufficiently so for my purpose.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he threw the volume down among its fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find some spicy writing there,&rsquo; said Crieff. &lsquo;A little out of date
      now, of course, for the new society journals have killed the &ldquo;Satyrnine,&rdquo;
       but it used to be deucedly clever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clever!&rsquo; echoed Sutherland. &lsquo;During the whole of last evening, and for
      hours this morning, I have been searching these volumes in vain for one
      spark of insight, for a ray of pure talent. They are simply trash, and
      spiteful trash, which is the worst of all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you expect too much, old fellow. The &ldquo;Satyrnine&rdquo; only professes
      to be smart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hate that word, though it expresses well enough the journalism we speak
      of&mdash;the journalism of the &ldquo;Satyr,&rdquo; who now wears fine clothes and
      calls himself a gentleman, but is at the best a production of literature&rsquo;s
      slimy deposits&mdash;a Faun, earth-grubbing, ugliness-loving, screeching
      at the mysteries of artistic sunlight and moonlight. Even your friend
      Lagardère&rsquo;s style is better&mdash;it makes no hideous pretences.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;m glad you see some merit in Lagardère, after all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this rubbish&rsquo;&mdash;here he touched the volume contemptuously with
      his foot&mdash;&lsquo;this rubbish, in its horrible baseness and unintelligence,
      has not even the redeeming quality of honesty. The writers are ignorant,
      but they are also vicious; uninstructed, but at the same time
      pertinacious. Who are these men? Does any one know them? I should be
      curious, for example, to see the goatfooted animal who wrote this article
      on Thackeray.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you see,&rsquo; answered Crieff, reflectively, &lsquo;they rather make a point
      of working in the dark, keeping up a mystery, so to speak; but nowadays,
      when the journal has gone downhill, and spicier papers like the &ldquo;Plain
      Speaker&rdquo; have practically killed it, the &ldquo;Satyrnines&rdquo; are better known
      than they used to be.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they persons of reputation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, no; of course not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some of them, perhaps,&rsquo; said Crieff, with a smile; &lsquo;but for the most part
      just like the rest of us&mdash;a mixed breed. There&rsquo;s our friend Gass,
      whom you met at Gavrolles&rsquo;; <i>he&rsquo;s</i> one. He has his finger in most
      journalistic pies, and writes on all sides to turn an honest penny.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; muttered Sutherland. &lsquo;I once had a &ldquo;Satyrnine Reviewer&rdquo; pointed
      out to me at a party. He looked like a creature fresh from some large
      drapery establishment; dressed within an inch of his life, with <i>pince-nez</i>
      on nose, but goat-eared and goat-footed for all that&mdash;I am sure the
      animal couldn&rsquo;t even spell. But turning from the men to the matter, what I
      have been most struck by in reading these wretched volumes is their utter
      want of the positively human qualities&mdash;veracity, reverence, generous
      aspiration. There is not a single public man of any nobility, either in
      politics or literature, who is not persistently gibbered at and reviled.
      Our present Liberal statesmen are insulted by the grossest personalities.
      Our great literary men are for the most part decried&mdash;when they are
      praised the reason is not far to seek. Thackeray, inspected by the Satyr,
      is &ldquo;no gentleman.&rdquo; * Dickens is an ignoramus. Browning is a dunce,
      ignorant even of grammar. Worse than this is the vicious determination to
      ignore any kind of modest merit. In the course of the long years over
      which these files extend, many men, now distinguished, have arisen. In no
      single instance has this representative journal been able to recognise the
      coming genius, or willing to help the struggling aspirant. The method has
      been to ignore new men as long as possible; then when ignorance could not
      be pleaded, to interpose every possible impertinence of interpretation
      between the men and the public; and finally, when they have been crowned,
      to insult them with a monkey&rsquo;s gibbering interposition. For fatuousness,
      ignorance, ami dwarfish spitefulness&mdash;in a word, for all the old ear
      tidiness of the cloven foot&mdash;commend me to this &ldquo;Satyrnine Review.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      * See the &lsquo;Roundabout Papers,&rsquo; <i>passim</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; says the practised Crieff, cheerily. &lsquo;Nemesis has come&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Satyrnine&rdquo; is done for. The curse of dulness is upon it. It once sold
      20,000. The other day, when it was in the market, it could hardly find a
      purchaser. It lingers on with a country subscription among retrograde old
      rectors and blue-buskin&rsquo;d village spinsters, but by-and-by the acidulous
      short paragraph system will conquer even <i>them</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Crieff, whose life was one of hard work and bustling visits, was
      about to take his departure, when at Sutherland&rsquo;s entreaty he promised to
      return for lunch; for Sutherland liked the little man, and found a curious
      fascination in his tittle-tattle concerning the world of art and letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day the two lunched together. For a wonder, it was an idle
      day with Crieff, and, once comfortably seated in an arm-chair, with a good
      cigar in his mouth, he seemed determined to enjoy himself. The two chatted
      pleasantly for some time; that is to say, the journalist, who was
      garrulous by nature and habit, chatted, and the other smoked, listened,
      and occasionally interpolated a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Crieff&rsquo;s face darkened, and, after looking keenly at his
      companion for a minute, he said, with a certain indignation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to give up Lagardère, after all. He&rsquo;s been at it
      again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m almost afraid to tell you, old fellow, for fear of arousing the
      slumbering lion. Yet I think it&rsquo;s only fair, as I fancy you take an
      interest in the lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. You remember the young actress who appeared at the Parthenon this
      summer? Ah, I see you do. Well, of course you know that she retired into
      private life&mdash;married Forster, the merchant, a rich man and a
      thoroughly good fellow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I heard of it, and&mdash;I was glad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so was I. She was too good for the stage. Well, now, I&rsquo;m afraid
      there&rsquo;s something unpleasant brewing. Just read this!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Crieff drew from his pocket several newspapers, and handed
      one, with a certain page turned down to indicate a paragraph, to
      Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper was the &lsquo;Plain Speaker,&rsquo; edited by Lagardère. The paragraph was
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does a talented young actress, who recently left the stage, and, in the
      words of the immortal &ldquo;Vilikens and his Dinah&rdquo; (why not, on this occasion,
      read &ldquo;Diana&rdquo;?), married a rich merchant who in London did dwell, recollect
      a certain boarding school somewhere in France, an infatuated male teacher,
      and an elopement? It is said that Luna was once caught tripping, to the
      great amusement of Pan and the Satyrs. Luna was another name for Diana. <i>Verb.
      sap</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he read, the lace of Sutherland grew black as night, his fist clenched,
      and he uttered an angry exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you understand the reference?&rsquo; asked Crieff. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t, but I think
      there is no doubt as to whom it points. But Lagardère is fond of
      reiteration. Read a little lower down.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Further down, after a number of jaunty and not too grammatical paragraphs
      on various topics of the day, came the following&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was last in Paris, and the guest of Gambetta (it is a curious
      fact, by the way, that Gambetta has an exceedingly foul breath, and seldom
      or never changes his woollen shirt or washes his large feet), our talk
      turned on a volume which had just appeared, &ldquo;Parfums de la Chair.&rdquo; The
      title having a strong attraction for the not too clean Republican, he had
      bought the book. He admired it exceedingly. The affair is brought to my
      memory by the fact that the author is now in London. The other night, when
      we met at the house of a mutual friend, I asked him if he had ever been at
      Brussels, and visited professionally at a certain boarding school, and, if
      so, whether he had acquired there sufficient classical attainments to tell
      me if the goddess Diana had ever eloped with her music master, or appeared
      upon the public stage?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland rose to his feet, crushing the paper between his clenched
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is simply devilish,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;O that I had the ruffian by the
      throat! I would choke him like a dog!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grant you it is horrible,&rsquo; said Crieff, &lsquo;but what does it mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cannot you see? It is an infernal plot to ruin an unhappy woman.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no doubt as to whom it points?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diana Vere was her stage name, you see? But is there any truth&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truth? Do you expect it from these vermin? Their end is calumny, torture
      their delight. If I were only her brother&mdash;even her friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh, what would you do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thrash this devil within an inch of his life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you did, he would only thank you for an excellent advertisement.
      That&rsquo;s the worst of it; he <i>lives</i> on recriminations. I&rsquo;m really very
      sorry; for Lagardère, I have always held, has his good points. He has
      really a kind heart, as has been repeatedly shown by his generosity to the
      sick and suffering. He got up that idea of supplying old toys to the sick
      children in the hospitals, and I know for a fact that he kept Potts
      Peters, the dramatist, from starvation. I don&rsquo;t think he realises the
      mischief he does. He calls it &ldquo;plain speaking,&rdquo; another name for calumny.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn him!&rsquo; said Sutherland between his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all my heart, but I&rsquo;ll pity him too; for one act of true kindness
      atones for many sins of judgment. But I haven&rsquo;t shown you all. The wasps
      are all at it. Look at this in the &ldquo;Whirligig.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed another journal to Sutherland, who took it with trembling hands,
      and, glancing down a number of paragraphs similar to those in the &lsquo;Plain
      Speaker,&rsquo; came upon the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Hubert, why will you pretend to omniscience? You are all very
      well when you are telling us of your escapades in Russia, and your sad
      experiences of theatrical mismanagement in St. Mary Axe, but you should
      really try to be correct in your classical gossip. Diana never bolted with
      a music master, and she was never at Brussels. The affair to which you
      allude took place at Rouen, and the gentleman was a teacher of languages.
      Try again, Hubert.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few general paragraphs, one of which accused a certain royal
      personage of having a <i>liaison</i> with his cook, came another piece of
      mysterious gossip:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it is to become a <i>cause célèbre</i>, no one will regret it more
      than myself; though I shall rejoice, too, if it brings the peccant fair
      one back to the stage. I am sorry for the husband, but it is really his
      own fault. A person so well known as an Art connoisseur ought to have seen
      at a glance that the picture was damaged&mdash;<i>before he bought it</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The italics were the writer&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livid with horror and indignation, Sutherland held the newspaper to
      Crieff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&mdash;who wrote this?&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yahoo, I suspect&mdash;the editor of the &ldquo;Whirligig.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who and what is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edgar Yahoo, the last descendant of the race of the Yahoos, for the
      history of which see Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gulliver&rdquo;; the only difference being that
      this Yahoo no longer waits upon the nobler animal, but delights in airing
      himself upon its back.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Explain!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yahoo lays claim to be the founder of the new system of journalism. From
      childhood upward he has aspired to be the social <i>chiffonnier</i> of his
      age. He rakes for garbage in the filth of the street and in the sewers.
      Don&rsquo;t you remember the verses MacAlpine wrote about him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Who prances on through Rotten Row
    </p>
    <p class="indent25">

      Who prances, ambles, to and fro,

      While all draw back to cry &lsquo;Beware!

    <p class="indent25">
      The Scavenger of Society!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear Sutherland, don&rsquo;t take this affair too
      seriously. It is very offensive, but no worse than they write of
      everybody, from the Queen downwards; and I dare say it will do the lady in
      question no real harm.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland was pacing up and down the room, a prey to the most violent
      agitation. He wheeled round suddenly, and faced his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even while we speak, perhaps the poisoned arrows have shot home. I can
      see the poor child&mdash;for she is still a child&mdash;sickening under
      the shameless attack. I picture to myself a broken heart, a ruined home,
      and then&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose the insinuations are false?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They may be false in essence, while having a certain foundation in fact.
      Remember the lines you yourself quoted to me when Lagardère was our theme
      on a former occasion&mdash;I mean the lines about &ldquo;A lie which is half a
      truth.&rdquo; Oh, it is horrible! horrible! I would rather live among the
      foulest of savages than among your literary Yahoos, your so-called human
      beings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland&rsquo;s fears were right. When the poisoned arrows of slander and
      calumny are in the air, it is not long ere they reach their victim; and
      even as he spoke the cowardly work was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Madeline drove down to the Grosvenor Library, of which she
      was a member, to change some books. When she had made her choice of some
      new literature, and handed it to her footman to place in her carriage, she
      went upstairs to the ladies&rsquo; reading-room on the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was quite empty, and she strolled from table to table, turning
      over the new magazines, glancing at the journals. Presently she sat down,
      and began reading one of the theatrical papers, full of current gossip;
      for the old interest in histrionic affairs still clung to her, though she
      had abandoned all thoughts of returning to the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the theatrical paper aside after a few minutes, she took the next
      journal which came to her hand. It was the &lsquo;Whirligig.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Idly and listlessly she began glancing over its imbecile tittle-tattle.
      Suddenly her gaze was riveted. She had come upon the paragraph beginning
      &lsquo;My dear Hubert.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the innuendo. That it referred to herself she could
      not doubt. Trembling like a leaf, she held the abominable journal in her
      hand, and almost by accident came upon the second paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read on in horror, stung to the quick&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A person so well known as an Art connoisseur ought to have seen at a
      glance that the picture was damaged, before he bought it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was real, then; all her horrible fear was justified. Her enemy had not
      threatened in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room swam round her as she sank back, half swooning in her chair.
      Fortunately there was no one to observe her, for her face was pale as
      marble, and she seemed like one about to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, summoning all her strength, she looked round the room, and her
      eye fell upon the last number ol the &lsquo;Plain Speaker.&rsquo; She remembered the
      paragraph beginning &lsquo;My dear Hubert and knowing enough of the amenities of
      personal journalism to be aware that the reference was to a paragraph in
      Lagardère&rsquo;s paper, she took that paper up and searched it for the poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not far to search. She came without delay on the allusions to
      Luna, Diana, Pan, and the Satyrs, and on the mysterious matter concerning
      a boarding school and a music master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper fell from her hands, and a low moan broke from her lips. She
      felt that she was lost indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than an hour elapsed before Madeline descended to her carriage. Her
      first impulse had been to fly, to destroy herself, to put herself beyond
      the power of calumny and cruelty. But at last, conquering her first fear,
      she determined to return home, and face her fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;A SELF-CONSTITUTED CHAMPION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>avrolles was an <i>artiste</i>,
      and, with an <i>artiste&rsquo;s</i> eye, he saw at a glance that the tactics of
      the newest thing in journalism furnished an admirable means of carrying
      out his designs. The affair was soon arranged. A few whispers at the Club,
      a few significant looks and intonations, a few anonymous lines to the
      editors of the society journals, and the thing was complete. It was a
      neck-to-neck race between Lagardère and the Yahoo as to which should use
      the poison first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles bought the &lsquo;Plain Speaker,&rsquo; and grinned diabolically. He bought
      the &lsquo;Whirligig,&rsquo; and positively beamed with malignant delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, madame!&rsquo; he murmured to himself, &lsquo;what will you say for yourself <i>now?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the aesthetic circle of which he was so brilliant an ornament, and
      where the scandal was soon the topic of passing conversation, Gavrolles
      assumed an aspect of lofty indignation, and affected to deplore the public
      taste which could find pleasure in journalism so <i>brutale</i>. Pressed
      by his intimates for an explanation of the innuendoes, he would smile
      sadly, pass his thin fingers through his hair, and profess his
      determination to &lsquo;compromise no one.&rsquo; There were subjects, he said, in
      which a woman&rsquo;s honour was concerned, and which he could not discuss;
      there were secrets which it was a man&rsquo;s duty to lock firmly in his breast,
      lest the happiness of another should suffer&mdash;ah, yes! And the lean
      young gentlemen and limp young ladies looked at their plaster of Paris
      idol with increased adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, it should be noted, Gavrolles was sincerely inspired by
      the Divine Muse. He wrote a great many verses, which he would read aloud
      to himself, with much gesticulation, in the privacy of his lodging.
      Sometimes he even entertained his aesthetic admirers with a selection from
      these splendid inspirations. Ponto was spellbound, sent a little article
      to the &lsquo;Megatherium&rsquo; as a sort of puff preliminary, expressing a hope that
      these new &lsquo;adumbrations of an august poesy&rsquo; would soon be published in
      post octavo, on rough paper with blunt type, like the divine &lsquo;Parfums de
      la Chair.&rsquo; As a specimen of the new work (which, he took occasion to say,
      posterity would remember when Racine, Molière, and Lamartine were all
      forgotten, and only Gautier, Baudelaire, and Gavrolles remembered) he
      quoted at full length the priceless pearl of loveliness, the &lsquo;ballade&rsquo;
      entitled &lsquo;Diane: Chute d&rsquo;un Ange.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as this great cosmic creature was sipping his coffee and
      turning over the leaves of a new book by Zola (not without much superfine
      disgust, for he held that eccentric writer in very genuine dislike), a
      gentleman was announced, and before Gavrolles could utter a word the
      gentleman entered. One glance at his face sufficed. The Frenchman had seen
      it already once or twice before, and hated it cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Sutherland,&rsquo; said the new comer, quietly closing the door
      behind him. &lsquo;Possibly you remember me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles rose smiling, though his cheek was a little pale, his mouth a
      little venomous. &lsquo;Ah! yes,&rsquo; he remembered well Monsieur Sutherland, who
      had been introduced to him by that &lsquo;drôle&rsquo; of a Crieff. He was delighted
      to make his acquaintance. If he could serve him in any way, he would be
      enraptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your rapture will diminish, perhaps,&rsquo; said Sutherland, paying no
      attention to the hand which waved him to a chair, &lsquo;when I tell you what
      brings me here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Gavrolles, rather nervously, for his visitor&rsquo;s manner
      was not encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have alluded to our second meeting. Pray do you remember our first?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our <i>first</i>, Monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did remember, only too well for his mental comfort, and even as he
      spoke the dreary <i>salle à manger</i> in the little French town arose
      before him, and he faced again the powerful figure with the stern eyes and
      the firm square jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a few years ago, in France. You had then in your company a young
      lady whom you called your wife, and to whom, suspecting the nature of your
      connection with her, I offered my assistance. I afterwards saw you again,
      when this lady was still in your power, and you were using her as the
      decoy of a gambling hell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles was now livid. He saw that his visitor meant mischief, and with
      an execration he sprang up as if to move to the door. But Sutherland
      blocked the way with an ominous scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep your seat! I have not yet done with you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur, this outrage&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah! do not trouble yourself to seem indignant. You shall hear me out.5
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do nothing of the kind!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you attempt to leave this room,&rsquo; said Sutherland calmly, &lsquo;I shall
      thrash you within an inch of your life!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he held in the air a riding-whip, which he appeared to have
      provided for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robber! assassin!&rsquo; cried Gavrolles, and he put the table between himself
      and his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am neither,&rsquo; said Sutherland. &lsquo;I am simply the friend of a lady whom it
      seems your determination to persecute and destroy. Nor is she the only one
      of your victims with whom I am acquainted. Have you forgotten Adèle
      Lambert?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know no such person.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a liar!&rsquo; returned Sutherland dryly. &lsquo;You know her&mdash;you
      betrayed her&mdash;only a few nights ago she struck you in the face.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave my apartment&mdash;scoundrel!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is you who are the scoundrel. I have come to call you to an account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles threw his arms in the air in savage desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know you or your degraded companions. If we were not living in a
      country where the code of honour is unknown, you should answer with your
      life for this outrage. But there! You are a coward, and trade upon the
      immunity given by your absurd laws. You know that we cannot in England
      meet as gentlemen&mdash;that is why you venture so far.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mistaken,&rsquo; returned Sutherland, still with the same <i>sang-froid</i>.
      &lsquo;It would give me the greatest pleasure to rid the world of so consummate
      a reptile, but that is neither here nor there. To come to my business. You
      must give me forthwith y our promise to abandon your persecution of Mrs.
      Forster, and to leave England with out delay.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, you do!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the lady?&rsquo; asked Gavrolles, with a sneer. &lsquo;Pray be explicit. I
      know no person of the name you mention.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean the wife of Mr. James Forster, of Kensington. Do not assume
      ignorance. I know the nature of your relations together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, but in your capacity of bully, of <i>bandit</i>, monsieur, you
      overrate my intelligence. I know the gentleman to whom you allude. I have
      not the pleasure of knowing his wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read those paragraphs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland drew from his breast pocket, and handed across the table,
      copies of the &lsquo;Whirligig&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Plain Speaker,&rsquo; with the passages
      concerning Madeline marked in pencil. Gavrolles glanced at them, and
      smiled curiously&mdash;then tossed them back across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You understand those references?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Completely,&rsquo; answered Gavrolles, with a mock bow. He was rapidly
      regaining his composure, and making ready to strike his strongest blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you have the assurance to tell me that you are unacquainted with the
      lady whose name I have mentioned?&rsquo; Gavrolles bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she not the same with whom I saw you in company over there in France?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if she is?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she is, you are a liar on your own showing. You professed not to know
      her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I professed nothing of the kind. I said I did not know <i>Mrs. Forster</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is the same person.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, that is impossible. She may be living under that gentleman&rsquo;s
      roof, she may even be bearing his name&mdash;but she is not <i>his wife!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Sutherland&rsquo;s turn to look astonished. Something in the man&rsquo;s
      supercilious smile, in his growing audacity and self-possession,
      disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&mdash;do you actually insinuate&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing whatever, monsieur. I merely state a fact. But before we continue
      the conversation, may I ask you a question? Has the lady herself sent you
      here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned Sutherland, with a heightened colour; &lsquo;I came on my own
      responsibility.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&mdash;a self-constituted champion, I presume?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you put it in that way, yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a friend of hers, of course?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so far her friend that I will not see her victimised by a
      scoundrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Referring to me, monsieur?&rsquo; asked Gavrolles, with venomous politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles, now completely master of himself, leant over the table and
      looked straight into Sutherland&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very impetuous, monsieur, and not too choice in your use of&mdash;what
      you call&mdash;Beelingsgate; but I should wish very much to give you a
      little piece of advice. Before you proceed any further in this affair I
      should recommend you to consult the lady herself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be better&mdash;for the lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the threatening significance of the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      tone; but, as he spoke, he took a cigarette from a box upon the table, lit
      it, and looked keenly through the smoke at Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he did not immediately reply, but seemed dubious and
      perplexed, Gavrolles airily continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am content, you see, to take the lady&rsquo;s opinion on the subject. If she
      sends you here as her accredited agent and defender, I will speak to you,
      as one gentleman to another. Even then, look you, I should be
      condescending, amiable. It is not every man who would permit a complete
      stranger to dictate to him on a matter concerning only himself and madame
      his wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried Sutherland, now thoroughly startled. &lsquo;You cannot
      mean that&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will permit me,&rsquo; said Gavrolles, now thoroughly master of the
      situation, &lsquo;I will explain; but bear in mind, monsieur, you have forced
      this avowal upon me by your brutal English violence. Otherwise, I should
      never have spoken. You have been good enough, Monsieur Sutherland, to say
      that I am a liar. <i>Au contraire</i>, I do not lie. When we first met, I
      said the young lady in my company was my wife. It was the truth. A little
      while ago, I said there was no such person as Mrs. Forster. It was the
      truth. Why? do you ask. Because a lady cannot bear the name of a second
      husband, when her first husband is alive.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the supreme assurance of the man; he spoke with the
      strength of a settled conviction. Sutherland looked at him in amaze, as
      the full horror of the situation dawned upon his bewildered mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought me a commonplace seducer,&rsquo; continued the Frenchman, loftily;
      &lsquo;on the contrary, I am an <i>artiste</i> and a man of honour. I took that
      lady in honourable marriage. Afterwards, a cruel series of events drew us
      asunder, that was all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You deserted her,&rsquo; cried Sutherland. &lsquo;You left her to starve or die!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unfortunately, we did not agree; she was violent, and I&mdash;I will
      confess it&mdash;I was violent too. <i>Eh bien</i>! At the time of which I
      speak I was heavily in debt, and had to escape my creditors. I asked her
      to accompany me, and she refused. A brief separation was necessary. Alas!
      Little did I dream that in so short a space of time she would forget her
      lawful husband, and contract a bigamous union with another man.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, then he concluded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, monsieur, the champion of madame, I hope you are satisfied. In any
      case, there is the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he sat down in his chair beside the fire as if intimating that
      the interview had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland stood perplexed, and watched him for some moments in silence.
      Then putting on his hat, he said in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your tale is plausible, but I do not believe it. In any case you proclaim
      yourself a scoundrel. If it were not for your victim&rsquo;s sake, for the fear
      of creating a scandal, I think I should carry out my promise, and thrash
      you. However, I shall postpone your punishment for the present. But
      remember, if the lady we have been discussing comes to grief through your
      malignity, if these calumnies grow, and any evil happens to her through
      them or you, you will have to settle accounts with <i>me!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he left the room, and rapidly descended the stairs into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he gone than Gavrolles, who with assumed <i>sang-froid</i>
      had with difficulty concealed a savage ferocity, sprang wildly up, crossed
      the room, and took from a sideboard an oblong mahogany box, which he
      opened with a small key. Inside was a set of delicately finished duelling
      pistols, with cartridges to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, with eyes flashing, mouth foaming, all his body working in
      epileptiform rage, Gavrolles took up one of the weapons, and evoked an
      imaginary opponent in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would thrash me, you would profane me with a blow!&rsquo; he hissed aloud.
      &lsquo;Ah, ruffian! bandit! devil! dog of an Englishman! if I had you before me&mdash;thus!&mdash;in
      my own country, I would put a bullet through your heart. Come again, with
      your bulldog face, and I shall be prepared!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words the cosmic creature put the pistol back in its case, and
      proceeded to dress himself for his usual morning promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sutherland was pursuing his way along the streets, in a brown
      study&mdash;or shall we rather say a black one&mdash;as expressed in a
      face of the blackest gloom. So! His ideal heroine, the idol he had set up
      in his heart as a type of all-patient and suffering woman, was a guilty
      creature, one who, to entrap an honourable man, had represented herself as
      single, whereas she knew that her husband lived! It was scarcely credible,
      yet the tale, as he had said, seemed plausible enough, and the Frenchman
      seemed to have the courage of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man less satisfied in his own mind of the superiority of the weaker sex
      over the stronger would doubtless have withdrawn from all interference in
      an affair so suspicious; but Sutherland, perhaps because he was a bachelor
      with very little practical experience of female baseness, took an
      optimistic view of womankind. He could scarcely conceive the idea of an
      utterly impure and wicked woman, though he had the strongest possible
      belief in the impurity and wickedness of men. He was thoroughly
      inexperienced, impartial, and ideal. Having decided in his own mind that
      women are the victims of a social conspiracy (a terrible social truth,
      although one which he lacked the worldly philosophy to formulate truly),
      he never hesitated for a moment to battle upon their side, with all the
      deep enthusiasm and moral pugnacity of his nature. So there is little
      occasion for wonder in the fact that the more he thought over the matter
      the deeper grew his conviction that Madeline was a martyr and Gavrolles an
      even blacker scoundrel than he had at first believed.

      CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;MADELINE PREPARES FOR FLIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ale as marble,
      like a woman to whom worldly phenomena can bring neither thought nor care,
      because she is doomed to an ignominious and cruel death, Madeline returned
      home. Entering the house, she fled up to her own room, and there,
      heartbroken and alone, remained face to face with her despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not weep&mdash;or pray. The sense of an arid and heart-burning
      oppression kept her eyes dry, and turned her heart, that might have been
      the fountain of pure prayer, to stone. She hated herself, the world, all
      that she had seen and known. God Himself seemed against her, for she knew
      her own innocence. Ah, yes! How she had tried, and tried, to be good, to
      be at peace; and it was all in vain. At every turn of her young life the
      evil shadow rose, pushing her down to some desolate abyss of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat thinking it all over, she seemed covered from head to foot with
      some horrible pollution. Though her spirit was pure, impurity was upon
      her, choking and stifling her with its abomination. She shuddered and
      moaned, praying for one thing only&mdash;that death might quickly come.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she say or do, when she saw the kind eyes harden into
      indignation, the kind lace darken with this last shame? Sooner or later,
      her husband must know the truth, if he did not know it already, if the
      malignant voices in the air had not already whispered it to him. She
      shrank in horror, thinking of how she could meet his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing now seemed certain to her&mdash;that the roof which covered her
      was no longer hers, that to remain with James Forster as his lawful wife
      was to live on in open adultery, which was not marriage. He himself> she
      knew, would be the first to recognise the infamy of that union; and then,
      even if <i>he</i> pitied her, as was faintly possible, how should she bear
      the scrutiny of the world, the worldly scorn of his sister&rsquo;s cruel eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat despairing there came a soft knock at the door, which she had
      locked on entering; and the voice of her little step-son cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma! mamma!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not answer, she seemed choking; and now for the first time her
      eyes were dim and blind. The cry was repeated&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma! mamma! open the door!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without stirring she at last found strength to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I, mamma! Let me in!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away, dear; I am dressing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa has sent me for you. He has just come home, and is waiting to see
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting to see her? She shuddered as if stabbed, and unconsciously made a
      gesture of supplication. Could he have heard the truth, or a whisper of
      the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma, do you hear? Will you not come?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She forced herself to answer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am coming. Go away now, dear! I will be down directly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she heard the little feet pattering away. She rose and wearily paced
      up and down the room. Her heart felt dead within her, her whole life
      frozen in her veins. She looked in the glass, and was startled at her
      face; it was so ghastly in its set look of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she do? She knew that if she did not go down Forster would be
      certain to come to seek her. At last she resolved in very desperation to
      answer his summons. She cared not what happened now; if the worst came, it
      must come sooner or later. Perhaps she might summon up courage to tell him
      the truth with her own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went slowly downstairs. In the lobby she saw the child, who ran to her
      and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa is in the study. Come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he tried to draw her along with him. She stooped and kissed him on the
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait for me in the drawing-room,&rsquo; she &lsquo;said. &lsquo;Is Aunt Margaret there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the boy. &lsquo;You will bring papa?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bounded from her, and she walked slowly towards the study. The door was
      closed, and for a moment she paused, faltering, before she opened it; then
      she passed in, and saw her husband sitting reading by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a newspaper in his hand. At a glance she recognised Lagardère&rsquo;s
      journal, the &lsquo;Plain Speaker.&rsquo; The room swam round her; she felt as if she
      was about to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Forster looked up with a bright smile, and tossed down the journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear Madeline,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You see I am home early again; I&rsquo;m
      afraid I&rsquo;m losing all my business habits. But good heavens!&rsquo; he continued,
      noticing her face, &lsquo;how pale you look! Is anything the matter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing; only&mdash;I have a bad headache.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry for that. Not so bad, I hope, as to prevent you going out this
      evening? Serena, who can&rsquo;t go, has sent me a box for the first night of &ldquo;A
      Trip to Scarborough,&rdquo; at the Parthenon. Talking of Serena, there is a most
      amusing &ldquo;Verbal Phototype&rdquo; of him in the &ldquo;Plain Speaker.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that he knew nothing, that he had heard nothing, read nothing&mdash;though
      the very journal which contained the poison had just left his hand.
      Madeline breathed again. There was at least to be a little respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you do not look at all yourself,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;and as the night is
      damp, you are perhaps better at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I cannot go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so sorry, as Aram&rsquo;s first nights are generally amusing, and you
      would have enjoyed yourself. What shall we do with the box? It is too
      late, I fear, to send it to any of your friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You</i> will go, of course,&rsquo; said Madeline eagerly. &lsquo;Miss Forster will
      go with you.*
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>No</i>; I shall remain with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>must</i> go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone was so strange, so full of entreaty, that Forster was startled.
      He gazed at his wife again with deep solicitude, and drew her gently to
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not think of going out and leaving you alone. My darling, you
      are far from well. You must see Dr. Quin to-morrow, and see if his advice
      is any use.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he drew her down as if to kiss her fondly; but with a nervous
      shudder she disengaged herself from his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;It is only a headache, and will pass away. You must
      go to the theatre with your sister; I shall be better&mdash;when you
      return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would much rather remain with you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I wish you to go&mdash;I&mdash;I should be wretched if you remained
      on my account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I should be wretched there without you. I really will not go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if I <i>wish</i> it, James?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you wish it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him sadly, and turned away; for her heart was bursting at
      sight of his kind face, so gentle and so unsuspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you wish it? You know, dearest, I have no pleasure in anything
      of this kind unless you are with me. I would rather have a quiet evening
      at home in your company than go out alone to any entertainment, however
      amusing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; she said in a low voice, &lsquo;but to-night&mdash;I would rather
      be alone. When you are gone, and all is quiet, I shall lie down, and when
      you come back I shall be quite well. So go, for my sake&mdash;I wish you
      to be there.&rsquo; Seeing her so persistent, and thinking her wish was a mere
      whim which it would be unkind not to gratify, Forster at last assented,
      though with a very unwilling mind. He was really alarmed at his wife&rsquo;s
      look and manner, and setting it down, in his loving solicitude, to some
      growing illness, he determined in his own mind to consult the family
      physician without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having extracted his promise, Madeline prepared to go. Before retiring,
      however, she took up the &lsquo;Plain Speaker,&rsquo; and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I take this with me? I may be able to read a little, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
      should like to read about Mr. Serena.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands shook like a leaf as she clutched the paper, her faced assumed
      an even ghastlier pallor. She moved tremulously to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not come down to dinner,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No? Then let me send you something to your room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not touch a morsel, while my headache lasts. Don&rsquo;t mind me, but
      go to the theatre and enjoy yourself. Good&mdash;good-bye!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not &lsquo;good-night,&rsquo; but &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo; He did not notice the words then, but
      they recurred to him long afterwards, with an ominous and piteous sound.
      As she uttered them, she yielded to an irresistible impulse, and, quickly
      returning to his side, stooped over him and kissed him. As she did so, he
      felt a hot tear fall upon his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, my darling!&rsquo; he cried in astonishment, and stretched out his
      arms to embrace her, but before he could do so she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled back to her lonely room, and there, locked in and alone, she
      threw herself upon the bed and sobbed wildly. By the bedside lay the fatal
      journal, which she had carried with her, and which had now fallen from her
      lax and feeble hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour and a half passed away. At last she heard a knock at the bedroom
      door, and then Forster&rsquo;s voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline, are you asleep? May I come in?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, trembling, for a little time before she replied. Then she
      answered, not rising from the bed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am trying to rest. I thought that you had gone to the theatre.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The carriage is at the dcor. How is your headache?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try to sleep, my darling. I shall come back very early.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him pass downstairs; then, rising from her bed, she listened
      eagerly. Presently she heard the front door open and close, and the
      carriage drive away. Her whole manner now changed, and she moved about her
      room, lifting one thing and another as if with a set determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had resolved to leave James Forster&rsquo;s house that night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;&lsquo;GOOD-BYE!&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o remain under
      that roof another night, when she knew the horrible truth, was
      profanation. For some days she had hoped and prayed that her enemy had
      lied when he claimed her as his lawful wife; and so, doubting and fearing,
      avoiding Forster&rsquo;s society on the plea of indisposition, she had delayed
      and waited. Now, however, delay was impossible. That her enemy meant
      mischief was proved by the fact that he had already breathed these
      slanders into the air. She could not stay to face the anger of the man she
      loved, or, worst of all, his sorrow. She would go at once, without another
      hour&rsquo;s delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her resolve once made, its very intensity sustained her. She dried her
      eyes, and quietly prepared to go forth on foot. At first she thought of
      taking with her a portion of her wardrobe, and a few simple ornaments
      which Forster had given her; but this thought was soon abandoned. Keeping
      on the dress she wore, a plain robe of dark material, she drew on a dark
      bonnet, and threw round her shoulders a shawl, the commonest thing of the
      kind she possessed, but costly nevertheless. In her impulsive haste she
      forgot the bracelets upon her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened till all was still. Then she stole softly downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall she hesitated. Should she leave him no message; no intimation
      of her resolve? If she disappeared without a word of explanation there
      would be a scandal, a hue and cry. Besides, it would be so cruel. No; she
      could not go away without leaving a few written words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed along the lobby into the little study, and sitting down in
      Forster&rsquo;s chair tried to scribble some hurried lines. As she did so her
      tears began to fall. She was sitting thus, in deep agitation, when a
      footman entered to attend to the fire, and, after standing amazed for a
      moment at the sight of his mistress, retired with a murmur of apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      This intrusion brought her back to herself. After writing and destroying
      several wild effusions, she wrote the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&lsquo;I am going away. Do not follow me or try to find me; by the time you
      receive this I shall perhaps have done with this world for ever. Try to
      forgive me. Indeed, indeed, I am grateful to you for all your goodness,
      but when you learn the truth you will see that I could not stay. Kiss your
      little boy for me. God bless him and you! &lsquo;Madeline.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper was wet with tears, but she folded it up and inclosed it in an
      envelope, which she addressed and left upon the study table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, shuddering, she rose and left the room, drawing down her thick veil
      over her face. In the lobby she met the same servant who had surprised her
      in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going out,&rsquo; she said, in reply to his amazed stare. &lsquo;If your master
      returns&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; exclaimed the man, &lsquo;but you can&rsquo;t think of it. It&rsquo;s
      pouring wet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot help that. It is very important.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aghast at her persistence, the man opened the front door, and she saw the
      gleam of the gas in the wet street and on the falling shafts of rain. He
      was about to interfere once more, when she slipped by him, and disappeared
      in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And without an umbrella, too!&rsquo; he afterwards explained to his
      fellow-servants. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s off her head, I think. I see the tears quite plain
      in her eyes as she sat writing in master&rsquo;s room. There&rsquo;s something wrong,
      I&rsquo;m sure; but, after all, it&rsquo;s no business ot mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock Forster and his sister returned from the
      theatre. On entering the house, Forster at once hurried upstairs to
      Madeline&rsquo;s boudoir, and found it empty, as well as the adjoining bedroom.
      Then he hastened downstairs, thinking to find his wife there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs he found Miss Forster, in low conversation with
      one of the men-servants. Without noticing their agitated appearance and
      demeanour, he inquired if Mrs. Forster was in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant did not reply, but Margaret Forster, very pale, placed her
      hand upon her brother&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline is not there,&rsquo; she said, adding, with an emotion unusual to her,
      while her eyes filled with tears, &lsquo;Oh, James! my poor brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster stood terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something has happened!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Madeline is ill? Where is she? For
      God&rsquo;s sake tell me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak, you! Are you dumb? Where is your mistress?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was about to make some blundering reply, when Miss Forster
      interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline is not at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at home!&rsquo; echoed Forster wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, James, keep calm! Perhaps she will soon come back; but she went out
      two hours ago on foot quite alone, and has not yet returned.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone out? And at such an hour, and on such a night. The thing seemed
      utterly inconceivable, and Forster could not trust his ears. But the
      servant on being pressed gave so circumstantial an account of what had
      occurred, that doubt was no longer possible. He reserved his most
      important piece of information till the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And please, sir, I think she left a letter for you, sir; leastways she
      was writing one, and I see it lying afterwards on the study table.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting to hear more, Forster rushed toward the study, while his
      sister still remained questioning the servant. A few minutes afterwards
      Miss Forster heard a cry and a fall, and on entering the study found
      Forster lying on the hearth, insensible, with Madeline&rsquo;s letter open in
      his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.&mdash;THE SEARCH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the first
      great shock that Forster had ever felt during a life of quiet activity,
      marked from time to time by small and frequently ignoble troubles; and it
      struck him like a thunderbolt&mdash;to use the familiar but terribly
      expressive simile. When he came to himself, he was like a man mentally
      stupefied and physically decrepit. He read the letter over and over again,
      and wept over it; and the more he read it, the less he understood its true
      meaning. Only one thing was clear&mdash;that Madeline had left his house
      of her own freewill, with no intention of returning, and with no hint of
      any reason for her flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his sister&rsquo;s entreaties, he himself left the house in search of
      the fugitive. It was now long past midnight, and the rain was still
      falling heavily; but he buttoned his greatcoat round him, and rushed out
      into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first inquiries were of the policemen in the neighbourhood, but they
      could tell him nothing. He hastened then to the nearest cabstand, thinking
      that possibly Madeline might have hired a vehicle there; but he gained no
      information. Then he stood helpless under the dark sky, in the midst of
      the great city, uncertain which way to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he had not the slightest clue to guide him in his search. Madeline had
      no friends in the city to whom she might fly; none, certainly to his
      knowledge, and White himself had told him that she was a friendless
      orphan. The thought of White, however, brought up the recollection of
      Madame de Berny, who had been keeping house for White when he died, and
      who was still, thanks to Forster&rsquo;s assistance, in possession of the old
      quarters, which she let in lodgings. It was just possible Madeline might
      have gone there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was enough. He hailed a hansom, and was driven rapidly to St.
      John&rsquo;s Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was doomed to disappointment. When he had aroused the sleeping house,
      and scared Madame de Berny out of her wits by the sight of his haggard,
      spectral face, he found that the poor soul knew nothing. He hurried away
      with scarcely a word of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that night he haunted the streets, seeking for a trace of any kind. Of
      course, it was in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after daybreak he returned to his lonely house and found his sister
      awaiting him in deep anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw by one glance at his face that he had been unsuccessful. He walked
      into the study, threw himself into a chair; she followed him, and touched
      him softly on the shoulder. He looked up wildly, like a man whose wits are
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard nothing?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared you would not,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;My dear James, you must have
      courage&mdash;you must look this terrible event in the face. May I speak
      to you? Do you think you can bear to talk of it, of her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you to say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was irritable, almost querulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only this, James&mdash;that you must not torture yourself unnecessarily.
      Remember there are others who love you&mdash;myself&mdash;your darling
      boy. If Madeline has left you, it is of her own freewill. I am not
      surprised that you have not found her; she doubtless provided well against
      that. She wished to leave you! Don&rsquo;t forget that!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should she wish it?&rsquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do other wives leave their husbands? They <i>do</i> leave them, every
      day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in her tone so significant, so ominous, that he could
      not misconceive her. He sprang up as if stung and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought Madeline quite happy in this house. I never thought she
      loved you as you deserved. If she is unworthy to bear your name&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is not unworthy! I will never believe it. I will not hear one word
      against her, even from you. Do you hear? not one word! I know you never
      cared for her, never treated her like a sister, and now you would poison
      my soul against her. I tell you I will not listen to you&mdash;never,
      never!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Forster felt not a little indignant; her brow darkened, and the
      sympathetic dimness passed away from her cold grey eyes; but being truly
      mistress of the situation, she could afford to be, and was, magnanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very unjust to me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but I shall think it is your
      trouble that speaks, and not yourself I have never been unkind to
      Madeline; on the contrary, I have treated her with the greatest affection
      and respect. If I have sometimes thought that she was scarcely conscious
      of the duties of a lady in her position, I have always silenced myself
      with the reflection that she was your choice. Yes, James, always No matter
      what I have feared, what I have seen, I have been silent for your sake.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of God,&rsquo; said Forster, impatiently, &lsquo;cease to torture me. If
      you know anything to relieve my suspense, speak out. If not, leave me,
      leave me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he sank again into his chair, hiding his face in his hands.
      She watched him for some moments in silence, sighing heavily and
      occasionally wiping her eyes, for she was genuinely affected; but with the
      firmness of a skilled surgeon, who sympathises with the patient whom it is
      impossible to spare, since a cruel operation is imperative, she at length
      spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will hear sad truths sooner or later, James; it is better that you
      should hear them first from me. I want you to understand, once for all,
      that it is useless to waste your strength, to break your heart, over what
      is irrecoverable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean Madeline? I tell you I will find her. If I search the whole
      world I will find her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you do, what then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will pray to her on my knees to return.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether she is worthy or unworthy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Margaret, take care! I won&rsquo;t hear one whisper against her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s lips tightened, and her surgical manner increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will not listen to me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;at least attend to what the
      world says. These papers were sent, under cover, to <i>me</i>, this
      morning. It is my duty, James, to bring them to your attention.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she handed to him copies of the &lsquo;Plain Speaker&rsquo; and the
      &lsquo;Whirligig&rsquo;; they had indeed been sent to her by an anonymous
      correspondent, who had taken the trouble to mark the obnoxious paragraphs
      very carefully in red ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster looked at them, and seemed to read them in a dazed, stupefied sort
      of way; and as he did so shudder after shudder ran through his frame. But
      he evinced less surprise than his sister had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, James, you understand these allusions? Do they refer in any
      way to your wife? In any case, can you explain them?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Yes!</i> he answered, looking up into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They refer to Madeline?9
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe so,&rsquo; he answered, rising; &lsquo;and now&mdash;oh,
    </p>
    <p>
      God!&mdash;I begin to see what has driven my darling away. She feared some
      infamous persecution; she dreaded these infernal slanders; she read these
      very words. But I will follow her. I will tell her&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;James, dear James, listen to me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are these insinuations <i>true?</i> Is there any foundation for the
      statement that&mdash;that when you married Madeline there was something
      dreadful, of which you knew nothing, in her past life?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a lie!&rsquo; cried Forster, with strange energy. &lsquo;She never deceived me&mdash;she
      is incapable of deceit&mdash;she is a martyr! Do you think that <i>I</i>
      doubt her? If you dream so, you little know either of us. She deceived me
      in nothing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there <i>was</i> some scandal, and you heard of it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever there was, <i>I knew</i>, answered Forster, firmly; &lsquo;but I will
      not discuss it&mdash;it is sacrilege!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a movement as if to leave the room, but Margaret, who had not yet
      applied the knife to her own satisfaction, again restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure you knew everything?&rsquo; she demanded sadly. &lsquo;Everything, I
      mean, before your marriage&mdash;and after?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned eagerly and looked at her, for he saw, by her tone and by the
      expression of her face, that her words meant more than met the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After our marriage?&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, James. Did Madeline inform you that recently, on two separate
      occasions, she had meetings with a French gentleman&mdash;with the very
      man, I believe, referred to in these paragraphs?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She had not! No, it is impossible!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she did not tell you?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is the truth!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not the truth&mdash;I will never believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat that it is my duty to make you do so,&rsquo; said Margaret Forster.
      &lsquo;Dear James, you must believe it&mdash;better now than later on. There is
      no smoke without fire&mdash;no slander without some foundation in fact.
      May I tell you all I heard?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that he was at her mercy; and forthwith, in her zeal to protect
      him against any further machinations of an unworthy woman, she informed
      him that she had herself witnessed the meeting with Gavrolles at the
      Countess Aurelia&rsquo;s, and had seen enough to shock and terrify her
      exceedingly. Then with a certain amount of nervousness, but no
      compunction, she admitted that, in duty to her brother, she had afterwards
      played the spy, and had watched from a distance, next day, the secret
      meeting at the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster heard her out with a strange sickness of heart; and when she had
      finished he looked at her with a face so wistful, so sorrowful, that she
      could no longer restrain her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, James!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;forget her! She was never worthy of your love.
      Think of those who do love you&mdash;and of your child!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her in a voice hollow but determined&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My first thought must be of <i>her</i>. What you have told me confirms me
      in my opinion that she is sinless. Until I find her and ask her
      forgiveness, I shall not rest. O Madeline! my love! my wife!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed weeping from the room. Miss Forster remained spell-bound. &lsquo;Find
      her, and ask her forgiveness?&rsquo; She could scarcely believe the evidence of
      her ears; the idea was so utterly preposterous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the circumstances of the case, it was impossible to advertise for
      the fugitive in the public journals, in any such way as would lead to her
      discovery and discomfiture. She had gone away of her own freewill, and any
      mystery attached to her disappearance was of her own making. To awaken the
      hue and cry for her by name would have been to set all the bells of
      slander pealing, and Forster was determined to spare both himself and the
      woman he loved so utter a humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he inserted in the &lsquo;agony&rsquo; column of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; a brief
      appeal, signed &lsquo;F.,&rsquo; and headed &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;s Gate,&rsquo; which the initiated only
      understood. Then he went to the head of a private inquiry office,
      conducted by a firm of ex-detectives, and secured his co-operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she&rsquo;s in London, we&rsquo;ll find her, sir,&rsquo; said the chief, a jaunty,
      military-looking man, with a bald head and French moustache and imperial.
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll set to work at once. You say she&rsquo;d no friends handy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, that I am aware of.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Equally sure, I suppose, that there ain&rsquo;t a gentleman in the case? Excuse
      me. All in the way of business, you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite certain she is alone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir. I&rsquo;ll let you know the moment we hear anything of
      importance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster was going to leave the office, when he suddenly recollected, with
      a shudder, his sister&rsquo;s insinuations as to the mysterious meetings with
      the Frenchman. With a deep sense of shame, while strongly expressing his
      own faith in his wife&rsquo;s purity, he explained to the officer what had taken
      place. That functionary immediately pricked up his ears, for he saw a
      clue. Could Forster supply him with the Frenchman&rsquo;s name? Forster could
      not, in the spur of the moment, but that afternoon he procured it from his
      sister (who had noted it carefully down for future use when at the
      Countess&rsquo;s), and sent it on to the inquiry office.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards he was informed, quasi-officially, that the French
      gentleman in question, M. Gavrolles, was living quietly at his London
      lodgings, and, though watched day and night, appeared quite innocent of
      any knowledge of the fugitive&rsquo;s whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, we may remark in parenthesis, was literally true. The news of
      Madeline&rsquo;s flight, which had, of course, been bruited abroad despite all
      Forster&rsquo;s precautions, had taken Gavrolles utterly by surprise. The cosmic
      creature felt himself circumvented, bewildered. His victim had escaped him
      for the time being, that was clear, and until she reappeared upon the
      scene he could do nothing whatever in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as the chief of the private inquiry office sat waiting for
      business, there was shown in a gentleman, who, after a brief conversation,
      proved to have come on the very same business already entrusted to the
      firm by Forster. He wished the strictest inquiry to be made concerning the
      whereabouts of the missing lady, until she was traced and discovered, when
      he was at once to receive intimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir,&rsquo; said the chief, looking very mysterious, &lsquo;but may
      I ask, are you any relation to the lady?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None whatever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A friend, perhaps?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scarcely that. I am interested deeply in her fate, however, and if you
      find out what has become of her I will pay you handsomely.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief seemed to reflect deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you mean any harm, sir,&rsquo; he said presently, &lsquo;and I can see
      you&rsquo;re a real gentleman, but you see we have to be careful. Is Mr. Forster
      a friend of yours?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw him in my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, of course, sir, you can&rsquo;t owe him any grudge?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not. All the harm I wish him is that he may recover his wife,
      and that they may be happily reconciled.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that we&rsquo;re instructed
      already&mdash;by the husband. You can&rsquo;t serve two masters, as the saying
      is, but if we can oblige you in any way, without breaking faith to our
      first employer, we&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can keep me informed of your progress, and if you are successful&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let you know? Well, I think we can promise that. I&rsquo;ll take down your
      name, if you please, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edgar Sutherland,&rsquo; replied the gentleman, adding the address of his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, sir,&rsquo; said the officer, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re not a friend of the poor
      gentleman&rsquo;s. He really <i>wants</i> a friend. To see him coming here day
      after day, as white as a ghost, and his eyes all wild with crying, almost
      turned me over, old hand as I am; and the rummest thing of all is, he
      won&rsquo;t hear a word, not as much as a whisper, against the lady&mdash;though
      it looks black about her, it really does. Good-morning, sir! We&rsquo;ll be sure
      to let you know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Sutherland been asked why he occupied himself so closely with the fate
      of a woman almost a stranger to him, he could hardly have replied. His
      first chivalrous interest had grown into a sentimental fancy, that was
      all; and being a man of very determined prepossessions, especially where
      his great hobby concerning Womanhood was concerned, he had been led on and
      on, from one phase of feeling to another, till his interest in Madeline
      became very like a strong ideal passion. Like all the world, he had heard
      of her disappearance, and, learning her connection with Gavrolles, he had
      a pretty shrewd guess at its cause. So he had yielded to his overmastering
      interest and curiosity, and determined to make the matter a subject for
      private, but thorough, inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before many days had passed he received a summons which caused him no
      little agitation. The chief wanted to see him at once. Madeline had been
      discovered, but under circumstances so dreadful that he scarcely dared to
      communicate them at all to her distracted husband.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII.&mdash;&lsquo;ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n arriving at the
      inquiry office, Sutherland was at once shown in to the chief of the
      establishment, who looked truly concerned and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad you&rsquo;ve come, sir,&rsquo; he said at once; &lsquo;for perhaps you can help me out
      of my quandary. You got my little note? Well, the fact is, I think&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      almost sure, in fact&mdash;that we&rsquo;ve discovered the lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you wrote; but how? Where? 9 &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a sad case!&rsquo; murmured the
      chief with a shake of the head. &lsquo;How we&rsquo;re to break it to the husband, who
      is half mad with grief and anxiety, is a puzzler. My great fear is that
      the news may get to him before we&rsquo;ve time to break it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Explain!&rsquo; cried Sutherland impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief opened his desk, and took out a large handbill, which he
      unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just look at this, sir,&rsquo; he said, while the young man read it with a
      shudder. &lsquo;This is only a copy of the bill which the police will have all
      over London to-morrow, and perhaps in some of the papers. I&rsquo;ve already
      been down to Chelsea to make an inspection, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any
      mistake about it. What makes it quite clear is the bracelets. Her
      Christian name&mdash;Madeline&mdash;is graven inside.&mdash;But you&rsquo;re not
      well, sir. I don&rsquo;t wonder it has turned you sick. Shall I give you a drop
      of brandy? I have it handy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland, who had turned faint and deadly pale, recovered himself with
      an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind me. Think of him, her husband. You say you haven&rsquo;t
      communicated with him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir. It was only found early this morning, and the moment I heard of
      the discovery I sent straight to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;But the police&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve squared that. They won&rsquo;t send to him to-night without communicating
      with me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The shock will be frightful&mdash;enough to kill him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt of that, but there&rsquo;s no help for it&mdash;he must know.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first thing to do is to make certain of the identity. The description
      may be misleading. I suppose I can see her?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, returned the chief with alacrity. &lsquo;If you like I&rsquo;ll go down
      with you at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Sutherland and the inquiry officer were rattling down
      towards Putney in a hansom cab. It was a dark and dismal afternoon in
      autumn, and as they rapidly passed the gates of Hyde Park the leafless
      trees looked desolate through a thin mist of rain. To the eye of Edgar
      Sutherland everything was sombre and dreadful, dark with tragic shadows of
      sin and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove through Knightsbridge to Hammersmith, then crossing Hammersmith
      Bridge, beneath which the river rolled black and sinister, came into the
      gloomy purlieus of a desolate waterside suburb. It was now growing dark,
      and the street lamps, which were few and far between, flashed dismally on
      cheerless brand-new villas, for the most part untenanted and faced with
      boards &lsquo;To Let,&rsquo; gloomy gardens, dark brickfields, and spaces of damp
      meadow stretching down to the river side. Here and there a tavern opened
      its bloodshot eyes, and attracted one or two dreary moths to its dingy
      gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing through a mile or more of this gloomy neighbourhood, the cab
      turned down a narrow street running at right angles to the river banks,
      and pulled up before a desolate stone building with the inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Police
      Station.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer alighted and led the way into a whitewashed room, lit by a
      solitary gas jet, and occupied by a policeman in uniform, who stood at a
      desk writing. Wafered on the wall, close to the desk, was a placard
      similar to that which Sutherland had already seen, headed in bold capitals&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      FOUND DROWNED!
    </h3>
    <p>
      and giving the description of the body of a female found that morning by a
      waterman in the near neighbourhood of Putney Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few hurried words with the inquiry officer, the police sergeant
      turned to Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wish to identify, sir? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find it a difficult job. As
      far as I can make out, it&rsquo;s been a long time in the water.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland shuddered as the sergeant, in the most business-like way
      possible, took down a key from a nail and led the way to the back of the
      building, across a damp yard, and up to a low wooden door: this he opened
      leisurely with his key, and revealed a sort of rude mortuary, lit by a gas
      jet turned so low down as to leave the place almost in darkness. They
      entered, and when the sergeant had leisurely turned up the gas, saw,
      stretched out upon a wooden slab, what had once been a living woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay exactly as she had been found, with clenched hands and shoeless
      feet, clad in a plain dress of serge, partly torn and eaten away. Round
      her shoulders were the remains of a valuable shawl, firmly secured by a
      large common shawl pin. Her head was bare, and the loose, fair hair,
      tangled and twisted in moist knots, hung around the disfigured lineaments
      of a skeletonian face. So horrible was this face, so unrecognisable in its
      lost humanity, that Sutherland almost swooned as he looked upon it. Alas,
      what likeness of living flesh and blood could he discover there?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must have been drifting up and down for weeks,&rsquo; said the sergeant
      with professional stolidity; &lsquo;and I suppose last night&rsquo;s high tide brought
      her up this way, and carried her into the shallows. There isn&rsquo;t much
      remaining of the poor creature except clothes, sir; and her own father
      could scarcely know her. Seems to have been a fine woman, and quite young,
      though it&rsquo;s hard to tell even that.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a ring on her finger,&rsquo; cried Sutherland&mdash;&lsquo;a wedding-ring?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; returned the sergeant, &lsquo;and I understand the missing lady was
      married. But I shouldn&rsquo;t go too much by that, sir. Most of the
      unfortunates who make a hole in the water wear wedding-rings. But these
      bracelets now, there&rsquo;s no mistaking <i>them</i>. Just look, sir.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the sergeant took from a slab at the corpse&rsquo;s side one or two
      elegant bracelets, greatly tarnished by the water, but of solid gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We took them off and had them cleaned for identification; they were in a
      shocking state, sir, and had worked right into the bone.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland took the bracelet, and uttered a horrified exclamation, as he
      deciphered, cut clearly on the solid surface, these words&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      At that very moment, as Sutherland stood looking at the bracelets and
      feeling his heart turn sick within him, a figure flitted in through the
      open door, and, pushing the two other men aside, gazed on the corpse with
      a face almost as terrible, almost as ghastly, as its own. The inquiry
      officer recognised James Forster in a moment, and made a movement as if to
      intercept his view of the dead woman, but in an instant he was on his
      knees, gazing wildly into the cold disfigured face, and stretching out his
      arms in horrified entreaty and recognition. &lsquo;Madeline! My darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild cry rang out in the desolate place, with a tone of infinite agony
      and woe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX.&mdash;DUST TO DUST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>et us draw a veil
      over the horrors and sorrows of that night. It is enough to say that the
      distracted husband, when he had recovered from the first paralysing shock
      of the spectacle, recognised without hesitation in the distorted and
      disfigured mass the remains of his beloved wife. But, indeed, there was no
      room for doubt. The form and complexion were the same, and the bracelets
      with their inscription placed the identity beyond question. Not without
      difficulty did Sutherland and the police officials persuade Forster to
      leave the corpse&rsquo;s side. He would fain have remained by it, watching and
      praying, till daybreak; but at last they prevailed, and Sutherland helped
      him home. His grief was, indeed, piteous to behold. After the first wild
      ebullition, he scarcely wept; his face was like a stone, set in horror and
      despair; only from to time he uttered a wild, heart-rending moan, and
      shivered through all his frame like a man struck by ague. So he was led
      home to his lonely house, to the care of his sister, who was stirred to
      the depths for his sake, and watched him with infinite tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Sutherland called, and Miss Forster rejoiced to see
      him and accepted with eagerness his offer of personal assistance. All
      night long her brother had remained like one physically crushed and
      broken, always conscious and uttering intermittent cries of pain. At
      daybreak he would have flown down to Putney, but they restrained him
      almost by main force, yet with less difficulty than might have been
      anticipated, for his strong will seemed shattered and all his spirit
      clouded as by a frightful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, under the circumstances, a public inquest was unavoidable. At
      the inquest, evidence of identity was given. Forster claimed the remains
      as those of his wife, and a sympathetic jury returned a verdict of
      &lsquo;Accidentally drowned.&rsquo; Society was for some days slightly agitated on the
      subject, the general impression being that the unfortunate lady, for some
      unexplained reason, had committed suicide. For a marvel, the so-called
      society journals preserved a decent silence; the fact being that
      Sutherland, in his capacity of self-constituted champion, had interviewed
      both Lagardère and Yahoo, and extracted from them, jointly and severally,
      a promise to abstain from any immediate allusions to the case. How he
      effected this object has never been disclosed; but he was, as we know, a
      determined man, and possibly the gentlemen perceived that publication
      would make a corporal chastisement inevitable. They were the more willing
      to forego their usual carrion as they were greatly exercising their
      readers at that time in speculations as to whether a certain Italian <i>prima
      donna</i> who shall be nameless was or was not the daughter of an
      itinerant pieman in the Seven Dials, and as to what were the precise
      relations between the Prince of Scotland and Mademoiselle Schwangau, the
      charming topical singer of the Parisian <i>cafés chantants</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came to pass that the poor remains, in a sealed coffin, were taken
      to Queen&rsquo;s Gate, and remained there until the day fixed for a quiet
      funeral. Most of the necessary arrangements were superintended by
      Sutherland, who had, as if almost by right, quietly established himself as
      a friend of the family. The brother and sister accepted his services
      gratefully, and almost without a word of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral took place at Kensal Green. The only followers were Forster
      and his new acquaintance. At the grave the former utterly broke down, his
      wild tears flowing for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men returned to Forster&rsquo;s house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never forget your kindness,&rsquo; said Forster, during an interval of
      comparative calmness. &lsquo;May God bless you for it! I am a broken man now,
      and have nothing left to live for; but while I live let us be friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he wrung the young man&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have nothing to thank me for,&rsquo; replied Sutherland. &lsquo;What I have done
      for you, I would, of course, do for any fellow-man in distress. But I had
      a deep respect, a profound sympathy, for your wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though, as I understand, you scarcely knew her,&rsquo; said Forster, not
      without a certain wistful curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not be said to know her at all. We met twice or thrice, almost as
      strangers, and then I saw her performances at the Parthenon.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were so happy,&rsquo; cried Forster, with a sudden access of passionate
      emotion; &lsquo;and she was so good! All goodness&mdash;all goodness! God knows
      under what misconceptions she left my roof. But I know she had an enemy,
      and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you bear to speak of that!&rsquo; interrupted Sutherland. &lsquo;Hitherto I have
      forborne from touching on the subject, but with your permission I should
      like to say a few words now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do so&mdash;I will try to attend.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware that Mrs. Forster was acquainted with a Frenchman, named
      Gavrolles, now in London?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know&mdash;forgive me if I pain you&mdash;the nature of her
      relations with him?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I do,&rsquo; returned Forster. &lsquo;Before my darling&rsquo;s guardian died, he
      confided to me that, when quite a child, she had been betrayed into a mock
      marriage with a foreigner, who almost immediately abandoned her. I knew
      this when I married her. I have no doubt that this Gavrolles is the same
      man; that he again thrust himself in her way; that, in order to avoid him,
      and dreading some misunderstanding on my part, she yielded to a wild
      impulse and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Forster broke down sobbing, and hid his face in his hands. Deeply
      moved, Sutherland touched him gently on the shoulder, as he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it has all been as you say. With regard to Mrs. Forster&rsquo;s first
      acquaintance with this man, I can myself tell you something which will, I
      think, convince you of her innocence in the matter.&rsquo; Sutherland thereupon
      briefly recounted his first meeting with Madeline in the hotel at Fecamp,
      his suspicions of her companions, his offers of assistance; and explained
      also briefly the part he had taken afterwards, when they met again in
      Paris&mdash;saying nothing, however, of his own temporary misconception of
      Madeline&rsquo;s true character, but describing the manner in which, on her
      abandonment by her pseudo-husband, he had restored her into the hands of
      her guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all I know,&rsquo; he said in conclusion, &lsquo;and I think it is enough to
      justify you in your noble faith in Mrs. Forster&rsquo;s honour. From first to
      last, when a mere child, she was this man&rsquo;s victim, and so sure as there
      is a God above us, her death lies at his door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with agitation, Forster rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he? Let me see him! Yes, you are right&mdash;he has killed her.
      Tell me where he is, that I may find him out, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a servant entered, bearing a card. A gentleman, he said,
      was waiting below desirous of seeing Mr. Forster on most important
      business. Almost mechanically Forster took the card and glanced at it. As
      he read the inscription upon it, he uttered a sharp cry and turned deathly
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graven on the card, in fantastic letters, with many characteristic
      flourishes, was the name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>M. Auguste de Gavrolles.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first shock of surprise over, Forster glanced up and found that
      Sutherland&rsquo;s eyes were bent inquiringly upon his. He handed him the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wish has been answered,&rsquo; he said with ominous calmness. &lsquo;The very man
      I most wished to see is here, only I had rather the meeting had taken
      place beneath any roof but mine;&rsquo; then turning to the servant, he added,
      &lsquo;Show the person into the drawing-room, and say I will come to him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant retired, and once more Sutherland and Forster were left alone.
      Sutherland stood as if transfixed, with the elegant piece of pasteboard
      bearing the Frenchman&rsquo;s name held still before his eyes; while Forster,
      bereft now of all his calmness, paced excitedly up and down the room. The
      sight of the Frenchman&rsquo;s name at such a time almost transformed him into a
      madman. Trembling from head to foot, yet pale as death, he at last rushed
      to the door, when Sutherland laid his hand upon his shoulder to detain
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you have made up your mind to meet the man.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, so far I think you have done well, but before you meet him will you
      listen to some advice from me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing against your own interest or <i>hers</i>. I know that if you had
      descended the stairs two minutes ago you would either have strangled this
      Frenchman or thrashed him within an inch of his life. Your conduct would
      have been justifiable, but not wise. You yourself would have regretted it
      before the morning. Be sure retribution shall come to him, though it may
      not come to-night. Now, I want you to forget for a time that this
      scoundrel ever intended the slightest harm to your dead wife.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the task will be a hard one, but remember it is for <i>her</i>
      sake. So far he has played his cards well. He knows even now that his
      person is sacred, because, if in your grief and anger you were tempted to
      assault him, you would only be the means of scandalising the name of the
      departed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Sutherland, what does all this mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only this. I want you to do me a favour. Will, you? Yes or no?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly, if I can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let <i>me</i> still be the champion of your wife?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is for <i>her</i> sake, remember. She shall be avenged but she must
      not be scandalised. This Frenchman has some deep motive in coming here. It
      would be well for both our sakes that I should learn what this motive is.
      Will you interview him in this room, and conceal me in some place where I
      can hear your conversation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Forster protested. To meet the Frenchman in a seemingly amiable
      spirit seemed beyond him, but Sutherland was so urgent in his pleading
      that at length his point was won. Forster yielded for Madeline&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small lavatory adjoining the study&mdash;into this Sutherland
      retired, leaving the door ajar. Forster by a tremendous effort controlled
      his agitation, and, ringing the bell, ordered the Frenchman to be shown in
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was neatly clad in black, and on his white face there was a grave look
      of sorrow. As the door closed behind him, he stepped daintily forward to
      where Forster sat, and as he did so a sickly perfume seemed to penetrate
      the whole atmosphere. Forster raised his head, looked at the Frenchman&rsquo;s
      outstretched hand, but did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, monsieur,&rsquo; exclamed Gavrolles, &lsquo;how shall I thank you for this
      interview? I know, monsieur, I must be <i>de trop</i> at such a time as
      this, but I am as it were a mere machine. I follow not my own
      inclinations, but the force of circumstances; they have brought me here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this what you have come to say to me?&rsquo; asked Forster coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not all, by no means all,&rsquo; returned the Frenchman eagerly; &lsquo;but before we
      proceed to business I must express to you, monsieur, my deep condolence in
      a great affliction which has befallen you!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster&rsquo;s face grew livid, he half rose from his chair; then remembering
      his promise to Sutherland he sank back again with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be careful,&rsquo; he said sternly. &lsquo;If you come here on business, pray state
      it without further preamble; at all events be good enough not to allude
      again to my domestic affairs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders and turned upon Forster a pair of
      eyes lit with a sickly sinister light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rsquo; he returned blandly. &lsquo;I am sorry if I have pained you&mdash;but
      in this world it is not the fortune of any one that his path should be all
      sunshine. Though it is much against my inclination, it is of your affairs
      that I must speak. Listen, monsieur. A little bird has already whispered
      abroad that Auguste de Gavrolles and Madame Forster were acquainted.
      Having learned so much, the curious are naturally anxious to hear more.
      They love romances. Here is one ready made, they say, but there is only
      one man who can tell it truly; and that man is Gavrolles. Accordingly
      Gavrolles is besieged. Well, he does not wish to speak, for though he has
      been maligned he is a man of honour and an <i>artiste</i>. He is on the
      horns of a dilemma. The only course for him to take would be to travel far
      away, but he is a poor man, and without money one can do nothing&mdash;absolutely
      nothing. Do you understand, monsieur?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I confess I do not.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I must speak more plainly. Would it not be well, if you said to me,
      &ldquo;Monsieur Gavrolles, since I am a rich man, it shall not be for the want
      of a little filthy lucre that my wife&rsquo;s name is unpleasantly discussed.
      You shall not want the means to move away.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and for a moment there was silence. The Frenchman&rsquo;s face went
      very pale, his smile became even more baleful, as he saw Forster rise
      slowly from his seat and point to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is enough,&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;leave my house. If we stood face to face
      beneath any other roof but mine, I&rsquo;d kill you like a dog.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur, you do not understand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not understand! You villain, I understand too well. I know what you have
      done. I know what you would do. You made my wife&rsquo;s life a hell; you
      tortured her into her grave; and now instead of feeling any pity for your
      victim, you come to me and ask me to pay you money to keep you from
      slandering her name. Leave my house, or as sure as there is a God above us
      I&rsquo;ll have you whipped like a cur into the street!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster was trembling from head to foot with rage. The Frenchman, who was
      still cool, turned to speak, but one look in the other&rsquo;s face silenced
      him. He made two steps towards the door; there he paused. He felt in his
      pocket, drew forth a card, wrote rapidly upon it, then turned to Forster
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; he said quietly, &lsquo;that is my address for three days at least.
      I leave it, in case you may wish to write to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and with a profound bow, he took his leave. Scarcely had the
      door closed upon the Frenchman when Sutherland burst excitedly into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Forster,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;once more will you do me a favour for your wife&rsquo;s
      sake?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Forster seemed deaf to his words. He sank into his chair, murmuring,
      in heart-broken tones&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline! my poor murdered wife 1&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, listen to me. Send the scoundrel the money&mdash;let him have his
      price&mdash;conditionally!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You advise me to do this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and whispered in Forster&rsquo;s ear&mdash;Forster started&mdash;the
      two men looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation Forster spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall have the money!&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will make those conditions?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster sat down at once, and wrote a note to Gavrolles. In it he said
      that he (Gavrolles) should be supplied with a certain sum, if he would
      pledge himself to return at once to France.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL.&mdash;&lsquo;RESURGAM.&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n a sombre autumn
      afternoon, the solitary figure of a woman stood looking backward and
      westward, towards the round red ball of the sun, which was sinking slowly
      into the very heart, as it were, of the great far-away cloud which she
      knew was London.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around her, on every side, stretched desolate marshes, silent save for
      the hoarse cry of a heron dapping slowly towards his crimson fishing
      pools, or for the faint forlorn whistle of a distant curlew. No other
      human figure was in sight, not even a human habitation; but over the trees
      of a lonely plantation, skirting the marshes to the southward, the spire
      of Grayfleet Church glittered back the rays of the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, though pale and haggard, was young and beautiful; and as she
      watched the far-off sunset its dim ray touched her cheeks with a faint
      tinge of red. She stood like one in a dream, shading her eyes and gazing
      on the dusky pageant&mdash;cloud, smoke, and mist irradiated into gloomy
      splendour, and assuming, as the fancy willed, strange forms of crumbling
      buildings, fiery streets, columns, roofs, arches, spires, and turrets, all
      duskily aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem real; no more real than the city she had left behind her,
      than the grave from which she had risen into some dimmer and sadder life.
      Yet her eyes dimmed with tears as she thought of one solitary figure
      waiting lonely and despairing yonder, listening for a foot that came not,
      praying for a love cast away and lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed real; not the cloudy pageant, or the darkening sun, or the
      desolate earth; not the life that she had lived, or the life that she had
      voluntarily left behind; not the long years of a confused and broken
      experience, chiefly of helplessness and sorrow; nothing but the clinging,
      contaminating sense of some great sin and shame. As a creature half choked
      and drowned, just dragged living out of some watery ooze, with all the
      foul moisture and the slimy filth clinging to her garments, this woman
      seemed and felt. The consciousness of a complete moral contamination, from
      which she had barely emerged, still remained with her, and not all the
      perfumes of Arabia could have cleansed it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been wandering in that dreary district for days, sleeping at night
      in lonely farmhouses and squalid inns, and ever creeping out in the early
      dawn to follow some aimless pilgrimage she scarcely knew whither. Yet all
      that afternoon she had been hanging around Grayfleet, looking in vain for
      some face that she might know and remember. She had stood gazing sadly at
      the little row of white-washed cottages where Mark and Luke Peartree once
      had dwelt; but strange folk now lived there, and the name of Peartree was
      quite forgotten. She had looked at the shining river, and she had seen, in
      a dream, the boat rowing in with its maimed and broken burden, while Uncle
      Luke stood in the bow wringing his hands. She had wandered into the old
      churchyard and looked in upon the very tombs where a troop of merry girls
      were playing, one happy Sabbath, so many years ago. Ah, that sweet, that
      far-off, half-forgotten life&mdash;was it all a dream too?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tramps and wanderers of all kinds were common in those parts, and few had
      paid any attention to the pale worn woman, plainly and poorly clad, who
      haunted the old village that afternoon. Now and then she had received a
      country greeting, and quietly replied. She had entered the Ferry Inn, and
      bought some bread and cheese, and while making her poor meal she had tried
      to question the landlord, a rough waterside character, about people she
      remembered. But he was a stranger where all seemed strangers. Then her
      feet had strayed again to the old churchyard, and this time she had
      strolled through the gate and searched among the graves. But she found no
      headstone or memorial to show her where Mark Peartree was lying, or where
      slept the kindly dame who had followed him so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the day passed, and in the afternoon she had come out again upon the
      lonely marshes, where she now stood watching the smoky sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes, it must all have been a dream. Wandering out of the great city,
      fearful of pursuit, with no definite aim or hopes save that of forgetting
      and of being forgot, she had strayed half unconsciously towards the old
      landmarks&mdash;towards the only spot in the world where she had known a
      happy and peaceful time. What impulse had brought her thither she could
      scarcely divine; it was an instinct that sometimes brings the bird to its
      deserted nest, the hare to its long-abandoned form. She herself quite knew
      that it was hopeless. She knew that the little household at Grayfleet had
      been desolate for years; and that the only surviving member of it, if
      indeed he still survived, was Luke Peartree, after whose whereabouts
      unavailing inquiries had been made again and again. After Madeline
      Hazelmere was sent to France she had heard nothing of her uncle; then her
      great trouble had come, and in its shadow, while it lasted, all else was
      forgotten; but once more, after her return to England, she had tried to
      discover poor Uncle Luke&rsquo;s whereabouts&mdash;always in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning her back at last on the sullen sunset, the woman wandered slowly
      along the narrow road which wound and wound for miles and miles, seaward,
      through the marshes. In the near distance on her right hand moved great
      sails, tall masts, smoking funnels, going and coming with a strange
      silentness; for the river was there, sunk so low down in its muddy bed
      that the traffic moving upon it had this curious appearance, as of ghostly
      objects moving to and fro, in silhouette, upon the solid earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked on and on still as if in a dream, and still with the sense of a
      suffocating taint. The sun sank into the sombre cloud of the distant city;
      darkness descended upon and rose from the marshes, save where here and
      there a roadside pool flashed duskily; and still she walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon rose large and yellow out of the far-off sea, and the air became
      full of a visible and delicate dimness. So dense was the stillness, so sad
      the darkening prospect all around, that now, more than ever, the woman
      seemed walking in a dead world, a world of weariful dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she reached another village, lying close down by the riverside. It
      was a small place, strongly saturated with brackish moisture, and much
      frequented by forlorn seagulls of a ragged species, too lazy and
      disreputable to earn a decent living out at sea. Here, in a peasant
      woman&rsquo;s house, she procured a bed, or rather a &lsquo;shake-down&rsquo; before the
      kitchen fire. The woman, a childless widow, stolid with ill fortune, dazed
      with a life of wretchedness, asked no questions, and seemed to note little
      difference between this delicate-skinned white-handed wanderer and tramps
      of the common sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning she was away again, in broken aimless flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was at last evident that the physical frame of this woman was
      unable to bear the strain put upon it by her impatient and apparently
      indomitable spirit. Her walk was weary and unsure, and very often she
      paused to rest; her breath came and went heavily; and in a word, her
      trembling frame and aching limbs betokened that her strength was failing
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midday a country fellow, driving a light farm cart, passed her,
      looked back, paused, drove on again, paused once more, and finally waited
      till she came up; then, after looking at her curiously from head to foot,
      accosted her as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Missis! Be you a-going to Seachester?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know the name, but scarcely knowing what she did she answered
      in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&mdash;Do you know, missis, how far it be?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From London, I s&rsquo;pose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and he continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it be seven miles, missis, to Seachester, and sure enough you seem
      dead beat. Telee what, missis! I&rsquo;ll give you a lift along.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary and overpowered, she accepted his offer, and with his assistance she
      climbed into they cart. They jogged along slowly, for the roads were heavy
      and clogged with mud. From time to time the man looked at her, surveying
      her quietly from head to foot, noting with no little surprise her delicate
      form, her small hands, her beautiful face. More than once he seemed about
      to question her, but refrained. To avoid meeting his inquisitive gaze, she
      closed her eyes, and presently, through sheer fatigue, she fell into a
      heavy doze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wakened by a hoarse voice in her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, missis, here we be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stirred, opened her eyes, and saw that they were standing near to a
      very small village, not far from a great water, the river or the sea.
      Shivering, and dazed, she alighted from the cart, and taking out a small
      purse offered the man a piece of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noa, keep your money, missis,&rsquo; he said, with a stern shake of his head.
      &lsquo;Look, now, this be Seachester, and up there be the house where you&rsquo;re
      a-going.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed as he spoke to a small cottage, like a lodge, standing
      surrounded by trees, at the gate of a kind of avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The house?&rsquo; she echoed. &lsquo;Do you mean where they will give me a night&rsquo;s
      lodging?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with a curious expression, indicative of rural suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re like the rest on &rsquo;em, missis! You know well enough where
      you&rsquo;re a-coming, but you won&rsquo;t let on to know. Never mind, you ain&rsquo;t the
      fust by many as has had a lift in my old cart. There, go up right through
      that gate, missis, and they&rsquo;ll give you a night&rsquo;s lodgings, never fear!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, with a grim nod, the countryman drove away, leaving the woman
      perplexed and even alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could he mean? Could he have any suspicion that she was a fugitive?
      She was too dazed and weak quite ta understand, or even heed his
      mysterious allusions. A sickening weight was on her heart, and though her
      hands and feet were stony cold, her frame was on fire. She stood
      tottering, as if about to faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was again afternoon, and the red sunlight fell on the little lodge and
      on the long avenue beyond, overshadowed with sere and yellow trees. The
      place seemed still and peaceful. She crept nearer, and presently stood
      with her face against the iron gate, looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood thus, there came on her ear the sound of female voices; and
      she saw approaching down the avenue, a troop of about thirty women walking
      in couples, talking and laughing as they came along. They were plainly
      dressed, for the most part in plain stuff dresses and dark shawls, and
      each wore a tight-fitting bonnet of the same description. On they came,
      chattering like children. Most of them, even in their not too becoming
      costume, showed the signs of personal comeliness, and a few were really
      pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly they turned into a side path and disappeared. The sound of their
      voices died quietly away among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling and wondering, the woman opened the iron gate and approached the
      door of the lodge. She knocked feebly, but in a moment the door was
      opened, and a goodlooking country dame, very clean and bright, stood on
      the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I&mdash;can I&mdash;&rsquo;&mdash;the wanderer began feebly, but breath
      failed her, and she stood trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, my dear,&rsquo; said the woman compassionately, leading her to a chair
      in a cosy little kitchen. &lsquo;Come in, and welcome. Lord, how pale you be!
      Have you come far?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I want&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind about that, <i>now</i>&mdash;wait till I get thee a nice drink
      of warm milk, and then you can go on the Home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as she spoke the wanderer fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good dame uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor dear, she&rsquo;s fainted. How wet and draggled she be! Why, she must have
      tramped it all the way. Here, Johnnie&mdash;Johnnie!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flaxen-haired boy of about twelve appeared on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Run up to the house, quick, and ask Sister Ursula, with mother&rsquo;s
      compliments, to step down here at once. Poor unfortunate,&rsquo; she continued,
      chafing the woman&rsquo;s fingers, &lsquo;what pretty white hands she has! She looks
      like a lady born!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.&mdash;THE SISTERS OF MOUNT EDEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> considerable
      interval of time must have passed from the moment when the woman recovered
      consciousness; for on opening her eyes she found herself lying in bed, in
      a large, dimly lighted room. The bed was white and clean, with snowy
      hangings, and the chamber contained four other beds of the same
      description. The curtains of the window were closely drawn, and on the
      hearth there burnt a cheerful fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated close to the bedside was a young girl, dressed like a nurse, in
      clean white cap, white apron and cotton gown, and reading a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes the wanderer lay silent, not stirring, but looking
      vacantly around her; on the cleanly papered walls, cosily lit by the
      firelight: on the engraving of the Crucifixion, hanging over the
      mantelpiece on the snowy beds, at the head of each of which hung a picture
      of the Madonna&mdash;each different, but all copies from the works of
      Raphael; and finally, on the quiet, thoughtful-looking girl, who sat
      intent upon her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, thoroughly awakened, she uttered an exclamation. The girl looked
      up, and their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where am I? What place is this? Why am I lying here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled, and, without answering, touched a handbell standing on a
      small table at her side. Scarcely had she done so when a tall, slight
      figure, also wearing a white cap, entered the room. Her hair was quite
      white, but her face seemed fresh and young; and her eyes had a cold
      virginal steadfastness which harmonised well with the lines of a mouth
      firm almost to hardness. No sooner, however, did her gaze fall upon the
      occupant of the bed than her face was lit by a smile of strange brightness
      and sweetness; the coldness passed from her eyes, the lines of her mouth
      grew soft and tender; and her whole expression was transformed into one of
      winning kindness and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose and curtsied as the newcomer advanced to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are better now?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer looked up wildly, scrutinising the kind thoughtful face which
      was bending over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo; she cried again. &lsquo;What place is this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are among friends,&rsquo; was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the hospital? Have I been ill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were faint and weak when they brought you in, and afterwards you fell
      into a sleep.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I remember&mdash;but this place, and you? I do not know you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Sister Ursula. Perhaps you have heard my name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor the name of this place&mdash;Mount Eden? 5
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no!5 cried the wanderer, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are welcome all the same; but, before we talk any more, let Barbara&rsquo;&mdash;here
      Barbara, as the young girl was called, curtsied&mdash;&lsquo;bring you some warm
      soup, or some tea and toast. I am sure you are weak from want of food.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the invalid, confused and to some extent alarmed by her position,
      refused to take any sustenance, but Sister Ursula, with gentle firmness,
      at last persuaded her to drink some warm tea and eat a little dry toast.
      When she had done so, and Barbara, at a signal from her superior, had
      retired, Sister Ursula sat quietly down by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, may I ask you a few questions about yourself? Do not think I
      speak from mere curiosity, and do not answer anything unless you please.
      In the first place, am I right in guessing that you are in trouble?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she answered, almost under her breath, the wanderer kept her large,
      wistful, watchful eyes fixed, with strange intensity, on the Sister&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next, may I ask your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, but at last, in the same low tone, the answer came&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane Peartree.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Jane (may I call you Jane? it is our habit in this place to call
      each other by the Christian name), I do not wish to inquire into your
      history, until you choose to tell me it, or any portion of it. What I wish
      you to do is to regard me and all here as friends and sufferers like
      yourself, sisters in sorrow and in heavenly hope. You will rest here,
      certain of help and sympathy, until such a time as you feel strong enough
      to face the world again. By-the-bye, are you a Londoner?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I was born in the country.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have lived&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not ask me! I cannot tell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she spoke, she turned her face upon the pillow, crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall tell me nothing,&rsquo; said the lady softly, &lsquo;until you wish it of
      your own freewill. I can see that you have had sorrow, great sorrow; and
      that, unlike so many who come here, your speech is gentle, and your manner
      that of a lady. Take courage! Whatever your offence has been, whatever
      pain you have undergone, you are as safe now as a little child on its
      mother&rsquo;s breast&mdash;no one can tempt you, no one can harm you, here.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer turned her face again, and looked long and wistfully at the
      Sister; then she sighed deeply, while her tears still fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not told me what place this is, but I suppose it is some
      religious home. Well, I am not religious; I scarcely know what religion
      is. All I ask is a night&rsquo;s shelter, and then&mdash;I will pay you for it,
      and go away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Ursula&rsquo;s face looked very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We never accept payment from those who take shelter here; and you are
      mistaken&mdash;this is not a religious house in the sense you mean. True,
      we believe in one God and one Redeemer, and our experience teaches us
      that, for the truly sorrowful and penitent, knowledge of Christ the
      Saviour is the only preservation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer sighed drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are Roman Catholics, I suppose?&rsquo; she said, with a curious
      indifference. &lsquo;I have heard they are good people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are of all religions,&rsquo; returned Sister Ursula, smiling; &lsquo;that is to
      say, the unfortunate are welcome here, whatever their creed. I myself am a
      member of the Church of England, but some of our inmates are Catholics,
      others Dissenters, many, like yourself, of no particular persuasion. We do
      not insist on these things. Our love and sympathy are for all the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the house is&mdash;not a religious house? What then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A refuge for sisters who have fallen, and who repent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wanderer shuddered, for she had read of such places; then, after a
      moment, she gave a low, faint, bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How stupid I was not to understand! And you think I am one of those&mdash;those
      women?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, Jane, that you have a great trouble, whatever it has been; but
      do not think I am judging you, or wishing to proclaim your fault. Whatever
      you are, I am no better than yourself. Twenty years ago I left a good
      husband, and lived in wickedness and shame with another man, who
      afterwards abandoned me. I have suffered a great deal, though no more than
      I deserve.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising herself upon her elbow, the woman calling herself Jane Pear tree
      gazed in amazement at the calm grey sister, who, without a tremor in her
      voice, coldly proclaimed her own sin to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no better than the worst here,&rsquo; said Sister Ursula; &lsquo;but my own
      experience has helped me to be of service to those who, like myself, have
      sinned and suffered. Many here are infinitely my superiors insomuch as
      they have suffered, and been dragged into pollution, through no fault of
      their own.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, a bell sounded in the distance, and a sound of footsteps was
      heard upon the staircase beyond the chamber. The door stood open, and Jane
      Peartree saw numerous female figures, all clad in white caps and aprons,
      pass quickly by. Several looked in, smiling at Sister Ursula, and cried,
      &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; Then four young women, clad like the others, entered that
      chamber, curtseying and looking curiously at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is ten o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; said Sister Ursula, rising, &lsquo;and bedtime. We
      breakfast early, at half-past seven, but you are weak and must not attempt
      to get up. Good-night, Jane.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping gently, the lady kissed Jane Peartree on the forehead, and then,
      with a bright good-night to the others, left the room, closing the door
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane lay still, and looked at her companions, who were slowly undressing
      by the light of a small lamp. The eldest was about eight-and-twenty, the
      youngest not much over eighteen; and, with one exception, they showed no
      refinement either of appearance or of manner, and clearly belonged to that
      portion of the lower orders from which society recruits its domestic
      servants. The exception was a pale, slender girl, obviously in delicate
      health, who exchanged but few remarks with her companions, and spoke, when
      she did speak, with a strong French accent. She sat on the side of the
      bed, slowly removing her outer garments, and breathing heavily, while the
      others chattered in low tones to each other and occasionally gave vent to
      a vacant giggling laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her eyes met those of Jane Peartree, and after a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation she walked across the room and stood by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, mademoiselle,&rsquo; she said gently, &lsquo;but you are not well, and you
      are a stranger. Can I get you anything?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane shook her head; then, seeing the other hesitate, and being attracted
      by her foreign grace, she asked, in her own tongue&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you French?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s face brightened strangely at the sound of her native language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mademoiselle; I am Belgian. I came from near Brussels.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adèle, mademoiselle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been long here&mdash;in this house, I mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not long&mdash;a few weeks. I was sick, and in need of country air, and a
      kind friend (ah, the kindest in the world) had me sent down here. It is
      very pleasant all around, and reminds me of my home, and Sister Ursula is
      so good, but there are many here whom you would detest. You, mademoiselle,
      are different; I saw that at a glance; for abroad we can tell a lady
      always from one of these <i>canaille!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl spoke rapidly in her own language, while her companions,
      attracted by the foreign speech, listened without understanding a word,
      whispered, and made signs to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mistake&mdash;&mdash;, I am no lady,&rsquo; cried Jane Peartree, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without contradicting her in speech, the French girl smiled sceptically
      and shook her head. She then began to prattle on, with the fluency of her
      race, until the new comer, sometimes listening and sometimes questioning,
      was furnished at last with a tolerably complete account of the house into
      which she had accidentally been brought, and of the individuals by whom
      she was surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house, as she had already been informed, was called Mount Eden, and it
      formed the centre of a small estate, consisting of woods, arable and
      grazing fields, farm buildings, and outlying cottages. Originally an old
      country manor, it had about ten years before come into the market, and had
      been purchased by the lady named Sister Ursula (partly out of a large
      inheritance of her own, and partly by means of voluntary subscription) for
      the purpose of founding in it a home for penitent and fallen women. The
      scheme on which the establishment was based was unusually wide and broad
      in its provisions. In the first place there were no religious barriers,
      and in the second place there was no attempt made to imitate the severe
      ethics of the penitentiary. The place was, in the truest sense, a Home.
      All the inmates, if in good health, were required to work in some way&mdash;generally
      in the way to which they had been best accustomed; some performing the
      higher or lower household duties; others working in the laundry; others,
      again, doing dairy and field work on the home farm&mdash;all in fact being
      occupied pleasantly and profitably, with a goodly share of interest in the
      result of their own labours. No attempt was made at any irritating
      supervision of the morals of the inmates; once admitted it was taken for
      granted that they were tired of evil doing, at any rate for the time
      being, and that it was unnecessary to preach to them, six days out of
      seven, on the wickedness of their ways. At the same time they were daily
      brought into contact with sound, sweet, and beautiful associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A special feature of the establishment, copied from some of the Magdalen
      institutions in France, was the reception&mdash;particularly in the summer
      season&mdash;of sick and delicate children, many of them babes in arms,
      from the neighbouring city. These children were distributed among the poor
      sisters, and it was wonderful to see with what eagerness they were
      received, with what tenderness they were guarded, by these kind
      foster-mothers. Many a helplessly degraded woman, on whom all their holy
      influences had been unavailing, was saved and consecrated by the necessity
      of tending a child; many an evil creature felt for the first time, with
      tiny arms clinging round her neck, the instincts of a pure maternity and
      the inspiration of a heavenly hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another rule, to which indeed the foregoing was a pendant, gave to an
      inmate, if a mother, the privilege of bringing her own offspring with her,
      and of rearing it in the house. No attempt was made to separate mother and
      child. No penitentiary laws were in existence, based upon the assumption
      that the former was an alien, and the latter a &lsquo;child of sin.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Ursula herself was the younger daughter of a peer of the realm. In
      her girlhood she had made a marriage, unfortunate in a worldly point of
      view, and had completed her folly by afterwards forming an attachment for
      an officer, with whom she eloped. Few, however, would have traced in that
      calm, cold face the record of strong passions and improprieties, if the
      lady herself had not, with a curious persistency, insisted on making no
      secret of her own sin; her theory being that one who had herself been a
      sinner, and sadly acquainted with the world&rsquo;s sorrows and temptations, was
      better qualified to deal with fellow-sinners than the most irreproachable
      of female saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night the wanderer snatched a troubled sleep, starting up at
      times to listen to the wind which shook the windows, and to gaze wildly
      round the dark room; but towards morning she slept quite soundly. She was
      awakened by the loud ringing of a bell in the hall below; and, opening her
      eyes, she saw the four companions of her chamber busy dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had she awakened than Adèle, who had been watching her, came
      over and said gently, in French:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you have slept, mademoiselle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree thanked her, and, rising on her elbow, looked round her, as
      if preparing to rise also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but you must not rise,&rsquo; continued the other. &lsquo;It is very early, and
      Sister Ursula says you are to keep your bed. Shall I fetch you a cup of
      tea?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree did not reply. She was looking around her in a vain search
      for the clothes she had worn the previous day, and of these there was no
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must get up,&rsquo; she said impatiently. &lsquo;Call the lady&mdash;tell her I
      wish to go. I have a long journey before me, and I cannot remain any
      longer in this place.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as she spoke her head swam round, and she sank shivering back
      upon her pillow. On her cheeks there were two hectic spots, her eyes
      seemed wild and wandering, and the left pupil of one was widely dilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards Sister Ursula entered the room, and, after a quiet
      good morning to the other women, bent over the occupant of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning, Jane,&rsquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree looked up; as she did so her face flushed and her teeth
      chattered in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please let me have my things,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I wish to go away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So soon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. They are following me. It will kill me if they find me. I am quite
      well. Quick! Let me go, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Ursula did not reply, but stooping over the bed took the girl&rsquo;s
      hand and placed her fingers upon the pulse, which she found bounding with
      all the force of violent fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take my advice,&rsquo; she said gravely, &lsquo;and stay with us to-day; to-morrow,
      perhaps, you will be strong enough to go.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite strong. I must go now. You have no right to detain me!&rsquo; cried
      the wanderer; and as she spoke she sat up, looking wildly and even angrily
      at her protectress. But it was only for a moment. Her head swam again, and
      she sank back shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, madame!&rsquo; cried Adèle, &lsquo;I am afraid she is very ill.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Sister Ursula. &lsquo;Go down, and leave us alone together.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, accustomed to obey, left the room in a body, and Sister Ursula
      sat down by the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree lay moaning, and it was soon evident that her mind was
      wandering. She made no more attempts to rise, but murmured wildly to
      herself. Presently, when Sister Ursula bent over to speak to her again,
      she remained with half-closed eyes and made no articulate reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor child,&rsquo; thought the lady. &lsquo;How pretty she looks, and different to
      most of those who come to this roof for shelter. And she has a secret,
      which weighs upon her mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She added, still to herself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Jane Peartree.&rdquo; That was the name she gave me. Yet the initials upon her
      linen are &ldquo;M. F.&rdquo; Who can she be?&rsquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XLII.&mdash;EXIT GAVROLLES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal weeks after
      the wandering woman, who called herself &lsquo;Jane Peartree,&rsquo; became an inmate
      of Mount Eden, that cosmic creature, Auguste de Gavrolles, author of the
      immortal &lsquo;Parfums de la Chair,&rsquo; was entertained at a little supper in the
      house of Ponto, the art-critic. The occasion was an interesting one,
      originating in the fact that London was about to lose, for a time at
      least, the light of the French poet&rsquo;s presence. Urgent private affairs, no
      less than the home-sickness of a great man for the scene of his struggles
      and his triumphs, were the reason of his departure. Frankly, as he
      confessed to his admirers, London was insufferably <i>bête</i> after the
      true centre of the universe, Paris. It contained many choice spirits,
      notably those who had nourished their sublime youth with the fiery
      fleshliness of the Impeccable Master, but even these could not compensate
      for the fine atmosphere of Parisian <i>salons</i>, the soul-satisfying
      sunlight of Parisian streets. In a word, both duty and pleasure beckoned
      the cosmic creature back to his Cosmos, and he was compelled, though with
      a certain reluctance, to say farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gathering was a very quiet one Ponto&rsquo;s house, situated in the dismally
      aesthetic region of Chiswick, was a small but elegant artistic villa,
      furnished in the superbest spirit of enlightened chilliness and elegant
      squalor. There, in a tiny reception room with golden-spotted walls and a
      cerulean ceiling, some dozen gentlemen and about half a dozen ladies
      assembled; among the company being the young aesthetic poets, Botticelli
      Jones and Omar Milde; Lady Milde, mother of the bard, known in her
      girlhood as the fair &lsquo;Lachryma&rsquo; of the albums; Gass and Barbius, Ponto&rsquo;s
      brother-critics; the editor of the &lsquo;Megatherium&rsquo;; Clothilde Max, daughter
      of the Teutonic patriot, Hermann Max; and a few others. The affair was
      affecting, if not festive. There were gay spongecakes and nondescript
      confectionery on a sideboard, together with the finest Marsala wine, for
      those who sought refreshment. When, in a few well-chosen words, Ponto
      wished Godspeed to the guest of the evening, several persons present were
      dismally affected. Gavrolles, more than usually jubilant, replied,
      thanking perfidious Albion, in the person of its noblest representatives,
      for their cordial treatment of him, a stranger, an exile. He had come to
      them on his merits, a poor <i>artiste</i>, a lover of the beautiful, a
      pupil of Gautier, and they had received him as a brother. He should bear
      back to his beloved Paris the memory of their kindness. He should inform
      his countrymen that France and England were thenceforth bound together by
      a tie stronger than all commercial treaties&mdash;the tie of sympathy in
      poetic aspirations, in divine Art. He should tell his compatriots that
      even in England, despite its Philistinism, despite its climate, there were
      singers as sweet and critics as profound as even those who possessed the
      inestimable advantages of a Parisian education. Need he mention, as a
      sample of all that was superb in song, his friend, Botticelli Jones? Need
      he cite, as an example of all that was subtle in perception and perfect in
      expression, the name of his friend and host&mdash;nay, might he not say,
      his brother?&mdash;Ponto, prince of critics?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lank and limp ladies clung around him, with every expression of
      sympathy and affection, until the hour of parting came. Then Gavrolles,
      with tears in his eyes, read aloud, with considerable emphasis, a French
      sonnet which he had composed for the occasion, and in which the names of
      many present were touchingly introduced. This effusion was afterwards
      passed from hand to hand until it reached the editor of the &lsquo;Megatherium,&rsquo;
      who claimed the privilege of publishing it in the forthcoming number of
      his journal, along with a reply (in the same language) from Young
      Botticelli Jones. Finally, the party separated, and Gavrolles, triumphant,
      drove home to his lodgings in a hansom cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening, bearing with him in a small portmanteau and a morocco
      hand-bag all his worldly goods, Gavrolles left Charing Cross by the night
      mail, <i>en route</i> for Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild wintry night, pitch dark, with gusts of rain and sleet; even
      the station looked dreary and forlorn, despite the pale brilliance of the
      electric light. Wrapt in a large travelling cloak, profusely trimmed with
      fur, and wearing an artistic felt hat, the broad brim of which was drawn
      down over his face, Gavrolles strolled up and down the platform with a
      theatrical swagger, taking care to clutch always his little handbag of
      black morocco. When the ticket office opened he approached the aperture,
      and, opening a purse full of bright new sovereigns, took a first-class
      ticket to Boulogne. He looked at nobody, heeded nobody, he seemed too
      obviously wrapt up in his own happy thoughts. His air, his walk, the
      feverishly delighted laugh in which he indulged from time to time, all
      seemed to betoken some special good fortune; and what wonder, seeing he
      had that very day cashed a large open cheque&mdash;payable to &lsquo;Bearer&rsquo;&mdash;at
      a London bank, and afterwards, at a neighbouring money-changer&rsquo;s,
      converted the greater portion of the amount into glittering coin of the
      French realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, had he been less jubilant and self-involved, he might have taken
      some little notice of his fellow-passengers&mdash;particularly of two
      individuals who, closely wrapped up and muffled almost to the eyes,
      observed him from a distance, listened in the shadow when, in a loud
      voice, he demanded his ticket, and then, after he had withdrawn, took two
      tickets, also for Boulogne, but second-class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The express left London and plunged into the darkness. Gavrolles found
      himself alone&mdash;for there were few passengers that night&mdash;in the
      smoking compartment of a first-class carriage. While the rain hissed upon
      the window pane, and the noise of the train drowned even the roaring of
      the wind, he opened his little handbag, and eagerly recounted his
      treasure. His eye glittered with delight as he fingered the glittering
      gold pieces, and found them all safe. Then he wrapt his cloak around him,
      and resigned himself to a doze.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Folkestone the weather looked ugly in the extreme; the wind roared, and
      the sea flashed in the darkness, while the packet rocked and throbbed with
      an uneasy motion. At first Gavrolles hesitated, but his horror of
      sea-sickness yielded to his intense longing to be again among certain
      choice spirits on his native soil, and with a few shivering compatriots he
      crept on board. Among those who followed him were the two men who had
      watched him so curiously at Charing Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage was a miserable one. Gavrolles, to whom expense was no
      consideration when he was in funds, occupied the deck cabin, and suffered
      agonies through seasickness. In the grey of a wintry morning, he alighted,
      a piteous spectacle, ghastly, dishevelled, hideous, on the quay at
      Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the groups assembled to see the voyagers alight was a white-haired
      woman, respectably but plainly dressed in black. She watched the
      passengers alighting one by one, until her eye fell upon a
      sinister-looking individual smoking, with serene defiance of the elements,
      a clay pipe. She at once greeted him by name, and, leading him aside,
      accosted him in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! do you come alone? Where are those in your charge?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calm yourself, madame,&rsquo; said the man with gruff politeness. &lsquo;I shall
      fulfil my contract. They would not cross in such weather.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they remain?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Safe in the charge of my wife, at Folkestone. You will find two of them
      charming; the third not so good-looking, but <i>très gentille</i>. As I
      wrote you, one is a domestic servant, another a tradesman&rsquo;s runaway
      daughter, the third a figurante of the theatre. They all seek situations,
      which I have promised them, as you are aware.&rsquo; &lsquo;But do they understand?
      With the last there was a scandal, and I want no more trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust my wife, madame; there will be no difficulty. As usual, when they
      find themselves under your kind care, they will behave discreetly.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Gavrolles crawled up the gangway, the picture of misery
      and collapse. No sooner did the woman espy him than she uttered an
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see another friend!&rsquo; she exclaimed to her companion. &lsquo;Go on to my
      house, and await me there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles, followed by a porter carrying his portmanteau, elbowed his way
      along the pier. Suddenly he felt a touch upon his arm, and, turning
      sharply, saw the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well met, Belleisle!&rsquo; she said with a grim smile and a not too amiable
      compression of the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      So worn and washed out was the cosmic creature that at the first glance he
      failed to recognise his old companion, Madame de Fontenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;Do you forget me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, his glazed and fish-like countenance expressed a dim and
      irritated recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it you, Madame Louise?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; it is I!&mdash;And you? It is many a long day since we met, though I
      have often inquired after you in vain. You are a sly rascal, Belleisle;
      you forget old friends, old services, old debts. Ah! but <i>I</i>
      remember.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been in England,&rsquo; replied Gavrolles, surveying her with strong
      dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, yes, so I heard. Have you been fortunate there, <i>mon ami?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary. But you? You live here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You follow the old trade, madame?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman nodded, and the two passed on in conversation. Gavrolles did not
      look back, or he would have seen, still watching him with curiosity, the
      two men who had followed him from Charing Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles slept that night in the Hôtel de Rouen, a chilly place,
      half-hotel, half-prison, in a back street of Boulogne. Here he had the
      pleasure of meeting two or three gentlemen of his acquaintance, who earned
      their money at the card table and in the billiard room, and spent it in
      dingy dissipation, like cavaliers of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one of these individuals, an elderly man in a seedy military undress,
      and with the face and manners of a fire-eater, Gavrolles strolled out next
      morning, cigar in mouth. Roaming along by the sea, he came face to face,
      in a quiet spot, with two Englishmen&mdash;James Forster and Edgar
      Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles started and turned livid, clinging to his companion&rsquo;s arm, as
      Sutherland accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I salute you, Monsieur Gavrolles. A word with you, if you please.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you seek with me?&rsquo; cried Gavrolles, shrilly, &lsquo;I see you are not
      alone. If <i>monsieur le mari</i> yonder wishes to recede from his
      bargain, it is too late. As for you, monsieur, I once warned you; and, as
      we are no longer in England, beware!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland smiled. Forster, who looked pale as death, was about to
      interpose, when the younger man continued: &lsquo;Monsieur Gavrolles, it is
      precisely because we are no longer in England that I accost you. Once, in
      London, you did me the honour to express a hope that we might meet on
      French soil. It was simply to realise that hope that my friend supplied
      you with money. You came&mdash;<i>we</i> followed&mdash;you understand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles shrank back from the powerful figure, and eyed the determined
      face with baleful hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no quarrel with you. I&mdash;I do not know you.&rsquo; Before Sutherland
      could say another word Forster interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man is right. As I said to you from the first&mdash;his quarrel is
      with me. Listen to me, man!&rsquo; he continued, facing Gavrolles. &lsquo;I am not a
      duellist, I know nothing of your weapons, but unless you consent to fight
      me I shall have you arrested as an extortioner and a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are still wanted in London, and if you refuse&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles, who had been watching the speaker keenly, and had paid
      particular attention to his words, answered with a scowl:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With you it is another affair, monsieur. I am at your service.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as you please. I am sorry that we could not end our little
      disagreement amicably, but since you are determined&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gavrolles shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland pulled Forster aside, while Gavrolles, with an ugly smile,
      turned and volubly explained matters to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mad!&rsquo; Sutherland cried. &lsquo;You should have left this affair to me.
      He is an expert duellist, and may kill you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if he does, so much the better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are determined?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. For God&rsquo;s sake settle the matter as soon as possible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Gavrolles&rsquo; companion with pompous dignity approached Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur, that is my card. I am the Chevalier de Beauvoisin, and I
      represent my friend. Where and when can I see you and arrange the
      preliminaries?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, on this spot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men walked aside, and remained for some minutes in conversation.
      Then Sutherland returned to Forster, took his arm, and led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is arranged for to-morrow at daybreak,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;on the sands yonder,
      two miles from Boulogne. As you are the challenger, they had the choice of
      weapons. They have chosen pistols.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you ever practised at a mark?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster-shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never fired a pistol in my life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it is an ugly affair. Let me entreat you, accept me as your
      substitute&mdash;I will force them to consent&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Forster with determination. &lsquo;It is my place, not yours. I
      shall either avenge my poor martyred wife or follow her to the grave.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.&mdash;ON BOULOGNE SANDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the early grey
      of the next morning, Forster and Sutherland stood waiting at the place
      appointed, a solitary spot just above high water mark. Far as the eye
      could see nothing was visible but the cold sea on the one hand, and the
      long, flat stretch of a great marsh, blackened here and there by leafless
      tree, upon the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are late,&rsquo; said Forster impatiently. &lsquo;If he should take flight after
      all.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he will come. But you are shaking like a leaf.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I am afraid?&rsquo; asked Forster with a strange smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland knew better, and shook his head sadly. But Forster&rsquo;s agitation,
      caused mainly by the mental strain of the last few days, filled him with
      deep concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later three figures emerged on the open space of sand. These
      were Gavrolles, the Chevalier, his second, carrying a case of duelling
      pistols, and a little baldheaded man, carrying another case filled with
      surgical instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier led Sutherland apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These are the weapons. Do they meet with your approbation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland examined the pistols, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you load them, monsieur, or shall I?&rsquo; asked the Chevalier, still
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland undertook the operation, while the Chevalier watched him
      keenly. The pistols loaded, Gavrolles took one, Forster the other, and
      they moved to their places. It was arranged that the Chevalier and
      Sutherland should simultaneously count ten, and then utter the word
      &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; which should be the signal for the duellists to discharge their
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland placed his man in position. So little did Forster know of how
      to protect himself, so clumsy was his exposure of his vital parts, that
      the surgeon in attendance uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mon Dieu!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;It is not like a duel&mdash;but an assassination!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with fear for Forster, who seemed quite helpless, Sutherland
      made one last appeal for him to withdraw, but the appeal was altogether
      useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, since it must be, cover your man well, and aim low. The
      moment the word is given, raise your aim and fire; don&rsquo;t lose an instant,
      or he will anticipate you. You understand?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The seconds moved away, while Gavrolles and Forster faced each other. On
      the face of the Frenchman there was a curious blending of self-confidence,
      malignity, and nervous anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose coldly over the damp sands, but the air was still dank and
      cold, and the seconds, in slow monotonous voices, began simultaneously to
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten&mdash;&lsquo;fire!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the last word was half pronounced, Gavrolles had raised his weapon,
      covered his opponent with lightning rapidity, and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment he was about to raise his pistol in the air, Forster
      felt his arm suddenly grow powerless, while the weapon dropped from his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland and the little surgeon simultaneously uttered an exclamation.
      The former reached his friend just in time to catch him in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is wounded!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I call you all to witness, it is a murder, not
      a duel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift as thought, the surgeon placed Forster on the ground, stripped off
      his coat, and cutting away a portion of his shirt, which was saturated
      with blood, disclosed an ugly wound in the shoulder. Forster, who had
      scarcely lost consciousness, opened his eyes with a twinge of pain, as the
      surgeon began to probe the wound for the bullet. It was the work of a
      moment; for the lead, after striking and partially fracturing the bone,
      had embedded itself in the fleshy part of the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not so bad as I feared,&rsquo; said the surgeon; &lsquo;but it was not fairly
      done.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was most foully done,&rsquo; cried Sutherland, springing up and facing
      Gavrolles, who had approached and stood very pale, looking on. &lsquo;Monsieur
      Gavrolles, it is now my turn. You shall fight <i>me!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do nothing of the kind,&rsquo; returned the Frenchman, turning on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you <i>shall!</i>&rsquo; Sutherland exclaimed, seizing him by the arm and
      whirling him savagely round. &lsquo;If you do not, I will shoot you like a dog.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stooped and picked up Forster&rsquo;s undischarged pistol, and
      covered Gavrolles, who cowered and shook like a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat, my friend has fallen by foul play. You fired too soon&mdash;ah
      I I know the old device of scoundrels like yourself. I demand
      satisfaction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Chevalier thought it time to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that is so, <i>I</i> am at your service.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All in good time, but my business is first with the assassin. I appeal to
      you as his second and a man of honour. Was it a fair duel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier scowled and looked uneasily from one to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a mistake, doubtless,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;your principal was so slow.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was no mistake; it was a <i>ruse</i>. He shall fight me&mdash;by God
      he shall!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier turned to Gavrolles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrolles shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man is mad&mdash;I have no quarrel with him&mdash;nevertheless, if he
      wishes to be served like his companion&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is impossible,&rsquo; said the Chevalier. &lsquo;An affair of honour must be
      conducted according to the code. Even if my friend consented to this
      preposterous arrangement, you would have to be properly represented, and,
      there being no second present, I decline, on my friend&rsquo;s account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the little surgeon, who had carefully drest Forster&rsquo;s wound, and
      placed him carefully and comfortably in a sitting posture against a large
      fragment of stone, leapt up in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, monsieur! I am here, and I will act as the English monsieur&rsquo;s
      second.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You?&rsquo; exclaimed the Chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Beauvoisin, I! I saw it all, and I repeat&mdash;it was not a duel,
      but an assassination.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur, take care!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you take care, Beauvoisin!&rsquo; screamed the little man fiercely. &lsquo;I
      refuse to be a party to a cheat, either with pistols or cards.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      More high words ensued, and the two combatants seemed likely to fly at
      each other&rsquo;s throats, when Gavrolles, who saw Sutherland still ready to
      fire upon him if he attempted to leave the ground, seized his second
      angrily by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is enough&mdash;I will fight the scoundrel. If he falls he will have
      himself to blame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So at last it was arranged. Gavrolles&rsquo; pistol was reloaded, while
      Sutherland still retained the weapon undischarged by Forster. The ground
      was measured; the men took their places, and the seconds stood aside,
      ready to give the signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged this time that &lsquo;three&rsquo; only should be counted, and the
      moment the last number was given the men were to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland stood cold and collected; Gavrolles, this time, shook
      violently, and seemed to lose his self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; he cried, just as the second prepared to count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! It is infamous! I will not fight again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he threw down his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A coward,&rsquo; said Sutherland; &lsquo;I thought so!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fire-eating Chevalier now walked over, lifted the weapon, and
      handed it back to his principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, you <i>must</i> fight now,&rsquo; he said grimly. &lsquo;If not, I
      shall proclaim you to be what the Englishman calls you, a coward.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With one fierce glare into his friend&rsquo;s face, Gavrolles snatched the
      pistol, uttered an execration, and again took his stand facing Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier walked back to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the last number was uttered, Gavrolles had raised his pistol; but
      Sutherland, who had watched him keenly, was as quick as he. The weapons
      were discharged simultaneously, and one sharp report rang out in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland stood unscathed, though the bullet had almost grazed his brow.
      Gavrolles, with a stifled scream, threw up his arms, and fell forward on
      his face&mdash;shot through the heart.

      CHAPTER XLIV.&mdash;&lsquo;JANE PEARTREE.&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he stream of my
      narrative, instead of lingering round that group of excited duellists on
      the French coast, turns again back to England, and to that place of refuge
      which the wandering woman, &lsquo;Jane Peartree,&rsquo; found in the extremity of her
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her first night under the roof of Mount Eden, and after her first
      wild impulse to rise and fly on and on, she subsided into a kind of
      restless slumber, accompanied with violent shivering and nausea, and
      before twenty-four hours had passed violent fever had set in. Over the
      details of this illness, which lasted many weeks, I have no intention to
      linger. We pass on to the period when the invalid, sufficiently
      convalescent to sit up in the smaller chamber to which she had been
      conveyed, began thoroughly to realise the fiery ordeal through which her
      life had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a room overlooking the lawn and shrubberies, which, at that season,
      were carpeted and draped with snow; and she sat one morning, looking out&mdash;on
      the white ground, on the shrouded trees, on the red sun beyond, hanging
      like a pink balloon close to the cold and foggy marshes, through which
      flowed the sullen Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      By her side stood the French girl Adèle, who, throughout the sickness, had
      been her voluntary nurse, and had watched her with extraordinary
      tenderness and care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are stronger to-day than ever, mademoiselle,&rsquo; she was saying in
      French; &lsquo;you will soon be able to leave this room.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The invalid sat silent, her eyes on the dreary, winter landscape, her pale
      beautiful face set like a mask of utter forlornness and despair; then
      slowly, convulsively, her bosom shook, her eyes filled, and large tears
      coursed silently over her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O mademoiselle, do not weep! It breaks my heart to see you. Courage! Are
      you not nearly well? Ah, yes! and there will be happy days in store for
      you, after so great trouble.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The invalid smiled sadly, and shook her head; then reaching out a wasted
      hand, she took one of the French girl&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adèle!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever care for any one very, very much? I don&rsquo;t mean foolishly,
      like young girls who think they love; but passionately, religiously, with
      your whole heart and soul? I do not speak of women, but of men, Adèle;
      though there are good women too.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a curiously beautiful shame Adèle turned her face away, while a faint
      flush crept over her face. After a moment she replied evasively:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are few good men, mademoiselle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But have you known none?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one&mdash;one only,&rsquo; replied Adèle with sudden warmth, &lsquo;and I think
      there is no other like him in the world. Ah, mademoiselle, it is so
      strange that you should ask me, since he is coming here to see me this
      very day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me about him, Adèle,&rsquo; said the invalid gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell you truly all he is, mademoiselle, I should have to tell you all
      I have been, and then, you might hate me! But no, you are too good. I know
      you have never been <i>there</i>&mdash;-where he found me&mdash;in the
      life which is worse than hell. If you have been unfortunate, you have
      not-been to blame; but I&mdash;I have been a devil, tempted by a devil!
      Ah, yes!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she proceeded, the girl seemed to yield more and more to the hysterical
      excitement of her temperament and race. Her face went ghastly pale, her
      eyes swam with tears, her hands opened and shut convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak of it,&rsquo; said the other, taking her hand again gently&mdash;&lsquo;since
      it gives you such pain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, mademoiselle, let me speak,&rsquo; returned Adèle struggling with her
      agitation, &lsquo;but I will not speak of <i>that</i>, but of him who raised me
      from it and saved my life for God. Twice, mademoiselle, he came like the
      angel he is; the first time it was too soon; the second time I thought it
      was the Lord Himself, standing&mdash;ah, so beautiful!&mdash;at my
      bedside.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and, pressing her hands upon her bosom, gazed out through the
      window, as if indeed she saw before her the heavenly vision of which she
      spoke. Then, after a little time, the invalid broke the silence, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I understand you. I, too, have known such a man as you describe&mdash;all
      goodness, all kindness&mdash;so different to the rest. But I brought great
      misery to him, and sometimes I think his heart must be quite broken. That
      is what fills me with despair.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly, mademoiselle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. If I could be certain that he was happy, that he had forgotten me, I
      should not mind.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was he your lover, mademoiselle?&rsquo; asked Adèle, suddenly looking into her
      companion&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was my husband,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adèle uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that is different!&rsquo; she cried in wonder. &lsquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;you
      left him, <i>madame?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Adèle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although you loved him so much!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I loved him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And does he live, <i>madame?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the softly summoned word &lsquo;madame,&rsquo; so significant of a new curiosity
      and a new respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he lives, unless he has died of sorrow. I brought disgrace upon him;
      it was unhappy for him that we ever met; and so&mdash;I left him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he know you are <i>here</i>, madame?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree started nervously; then, smiling sadly at her own terror,
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are really <i>his wife</i>, madame?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adèle walked to the window thoughtfully, and stood there continuing the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be so dreadful,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for husband and wife to part. I was
      never married, madame, but I understand. A little time ago I was reading
      in an English newspaper, of an English merchant, a rich man, whose wife
      left him suddenly, and no one knew why. She had been an actress in the
      theatre, and he had fallen in love with her upon the stage. Then, owing to
      some disagreement, she ran away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Adèle was not looking at her companion; otherwise she would
      have been startled by the change that had come over her. Leaning back in
      her invalid chair, with the last trace of colour faded from her cheek, and
      her form trembling violently, she murmured, in a voice of forced composure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes;&mdash;and did she return?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, no, madame. The lady drowned herself that very night, and the body
      was afterwards found in the <i>Morgue</i>, at the police station, and
      identified by her husband. It was the account of the inquest which I read
      in the journals. Though the body had been long in the water, and was quite
      disfigured, the husband recognised it at once.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Easily. By the clothes upon it, and by a pair of bracelets which the
      gentleman&rsquo;s sister had given to the lady, as a birthday gift.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The invalid uttered a low moan, and Adèle, approaching her, saw with
      surprise that she had fainted in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reproaching herself for having wearied out her charge, the French girl
      knelt by her side, chafed her hands, and gradually drew her back to
      consciousness. At last opening her eyes, she shuddered violently, and
      shrank away as if possessed by some unaccountable terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane! Madame! Calm yourself. It is I, Adèle. Forgive me for tiring you
      with my foolish chatter, since you are so weak. I will fetch you your
      beef-tea, and then you will be better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the invalid became more composed, and partook of the nourishment
      which the kind nurse brought to her; but she still, from time to time,
      seemed to fix her eyes on some sight of horror, and to tremble with secret
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later in the day, as she sat leaning back in her chair and gazing
      in the fire, she heard the sound of wheels on the gravel outside. Adèle,
      who was at the window, uttered a joyful cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame! it is he! it is my friend!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later came a message from Sister Ursula saying that Adèle
      was wanted below, and that during her absence the messenger, a young
      country girl of seventeen, was to remain in the sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adèle, with sparkling eyes and heightened colour, kissed the invalid, and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long time elapsed. Jane Peartree, with her eyes on the fire, fell into a
      light sleep, broken by feverish flashes of dream. She was awakened by the
      sound of voices at her door. Then Adèle, smiling brightly, entered,
      accompanied by Sister Ursula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have brought my friend,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;to speak to you before he goes.
      Come in, Mr. Sutherland.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Jane Peartree could reply, a gentleman, hat in hand, entered the
      room. The invalid looked up as if startled, sat erect in her chair, and
      the full light of the wintry afternoon fell upon her beautiful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not recognise the gentleman, but at the first glance he, to her
      horror and alarm, seemed to recognise her. Turning ghastly pale, and
      uttering a wild exclamation, he stood and gazed upon her, as upon a spirit
      risen from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; cried Sister Ursula, in astonishment, while Adèle
      Lambert stood by trembling, and Jane Peartree, startled and terrified,
      shrank back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But directly the first shock of surprise was over Sutherland mastered his
      agitation, and quietly advanced into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; he said to Sister Ursula. &lsquo;Pray forgive my stupidity, but
      for the moment I was startled out of my self-possession by a somewhat
      singular resemblance.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He added, looking steadily at Jane Peartree:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They tell me you have been very ill. I trust you are now almost well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for a reply, but none came. Jane Peartree still shrank back in
      terror or aversion, and endeavoured to turn away her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You spoke of a resemblance,&rsquo; said Sister Ursula. &lsquo;What did you mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland still kept his eyes upon the averted form of Jane Peartree, and
      saw that it trembled violently, as he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is scarcely worth mentioning further, for such resemblances are
      common; but at the first glance, this lady seemed very like a person I
      once knew.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To his intense surprise, Jane Peartree now turned her eyes and looked
      steadily up at him. Her face was white as death, but firm and resolved.
      Again the peculiar likeness struck him, and he gazed in wonder; but she
      bore his gaze steadily, as she asked, in a low deep tone, very unlike that
      of her usual voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the person of whom you speak?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady&mdash;a married lady.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A friend of yours, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scarcely that; one whom I met on several occasions, and whose character I
      greatly admired.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she still living, sir?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she is dead,&rsquo; answered Sutherland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree turned her eyes away, and sighed heavily, while Adèle
      stepped to the side of the chair, and adjusted the pillows behind her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her life was unhappy,&rsquo; Sutherland, continued, &lsquo;and her death was very
      pitiful. She had just this lady&rsquo;s eyes, her hair, even something of her
      voice. If a human being could rise from the grave, I should say this lady
      was the same; that I know is impossible. Ah! if she only lived&mdash;if I
      could only see her again&mdash;if I could only tell her of what has passed
      since she died!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he quietly watched the invalid, and saw that she was still
      greatly agitated. Eager to spare her pain, though still strangely curious
      and suspicious, he changed the conversation, and talked lightly for some
      minutes to Adèle and Sister Ursula. Finally he glanced towards the door,
      and held out his hand to the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, sir,&rsquo; said Jane Peartree, not turning her face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Adèle,&rsquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, monsieur,&rsquo; answered Adèle, looking at him with bright, almost
      worshipping eyes; then, lifting his hand to her lips, she kissed it
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanied by Sister Ursula, Sutherland descended to the lower part of
      the house, and entered a small sitting-room, or office, reserved for the
      superior&rsquo;s private use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me something more of your invalid,&rsquo; he said quickly. &lsquo;I feel rather
      interested in her. What did you say was her name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane Peartree.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jane Peartree?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but it may be assumed. I have noticed one thing which I may tell you
      in confidence. The initials on the clothes she wore when she came here are
      quite different.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not &ldquo;J. P.&rdquo;&mdash;but &ldquo;M. F.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland started in new surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, &ldquo;M. F.&rdquo; Do you know any person with those initials? Who was the
      person to whom you referred upstairs?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland&rsquo;s reply was singular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell you; not, at least, to-night. Promise me, however, before I
      go, that this lady&mdash;she is a lady, that is clear, and very different
      to the usual inmates of the Home&mdash;shall not go away from Mount Eden
      until you hear from me again. In the meantime assure her, should she
      question you, that I have <i>not</i> recognised her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you have not recognised her?&rsquo; echoed Sister Ursula, puzzled and
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so. It is important that you should not alarm her; it is equally
      important that she should not be lost sight of, if what I suspect is
      possible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can you not explain?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not ask me to-night. As soon as I can I will write&mdash;or come to
      you. Pray trust me in this matter; it is a sort of miracle, not quite
      comprehended even by myself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; returned Sister Ursula, smiling, &lsquo;since you are
      determined to be inscrutable.&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV.&mdash;AN OLD PICTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now before I
      go,&rsquo; said Sutherland, changing his manner, &lsquo;I have something for you: I
      think it will be a surprise. Look there!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So speaking, he took out a pocket-book and drew from it a cheque for fifty
      pounds, payable to &lsquo;bearer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Sister Ursula; &lsquo;another contribution to Mount Eden. Ah! you
      are indefatigable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you this is quite a windfall; I did not even shake the tree.
      Look at the signature. Do you know it? 5 &lsquo;&ldquo;Hubert Lagardère.&rdquo; No!&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Lagardère, the editor of the &ldquo;Plain Speaker.&rdquo;&rsquo; Sister Ursula raised her
      eyebrows and lifted her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man! Why, I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so did I,&rsquo; cried Sutherland, laughing. &lsquo;So thorough a worldling did I
      think him, that I have been twice on the point of horsewhipping him. Well,
      I was sitting yesterday morning in my rooms when he was shown in. It
      turned out afterwards that he had seen my name connected in some way with
      this institution. He entered mysteriously, carefully closed the door, and
      before I could address him he handed me that cheque, with the intimation
      that it was to be paid over to you. &ldquo;It seems to me rather a good sort of
      idea,&rdquo; he said in his drawling way; &ldquo;so I have brought you a trifle I won
      from Banbri Pasha last night at nap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Lagardère,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give you credit for so much
      sympathy with misfortune.&rdquo; I added: &ldquo;I shall have much pleasure in making
      public acknowledgment of your liberality.&rdquo; As I spoke the words he
      trembled violently and clutched me by the arm.&rsquo; &lsquo;How singular!&rsquo; said
      Sister Ursula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is only just. To be frank, I, in common with many
      others, have held your style of journalism in the utmost detestation. In
      one case, at least, I know you have helped to wreck a human life; it is
      only fair to proclaim that you are perhaps penitent, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted me with an expletive. &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; he exclaimed;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to be a saint, and I won&rsquo;t have my character taken away.
      Damme, sir, what would the readers of the &lsquo;Plain Speaker&rsquo; think, if they
      thought I had any commonplace compunctions? They&rsquo;d all go back to the
      &lsquo;Whirligig,&rsquo; vote me a molly-coddle, and, as a journalist, I should be
      ruined.&rdquo; So I took the cheque, on the condition that I should not disturb
      the public in its happy confidence in the moral perversity of the donor.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Ursula joined heartily in Sutherland&rsquo;s laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you have certainly discovered a phenomenon. Most men,
      even some good men, like to have their charities written large for the
      world to read; whereas Mr. Lagardère is actually ashamed of a good
      action.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; answered Sutherland, as they shook hands, &lsquo;he is what the
      world has made him. In a society which sets success above goodness, and
      despises any kind of sentiment, he poses as a Cockney Mephistopheles. For
      the future I shall never think of him without calling up the lines of
      Burns:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then fare-thee-weel, auld Nickie-Ben,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ah, wad you tak&rsquo; a thoucht, and men&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

      E&rsquo;en for <i>your</i> sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For &ldquo;den&rdquo; substitute &ldquo;journal,&rdquo; and the allusion&mdash;though not the
      rhyme&mdash;would be perfect. I, for one, am &ldquo;wae to think&rdquo; of the
      diabolic journalism of the period, even for the sake of&mdash;Lagardère!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sutherland hurried away through the night, driving to catch a late
      train at a lonely railway station seven miles from Mount Eden, his
      thoughts were not of Lagardère and the newest thing in journalism, but of
      her whom that man and that system had helped to destroy. A wild suspicion,
      deepening almost to certainty, and based upon the extraordinary
      resemblance between Madeline Forster and the woman calling herself Jane
      Peartree, had complete possession of his mind. Strange and impossible as
      it seemed, he could not shake away the belief that Jane Peartree was, in
      flesh or spirit, the living image of the woman whose death he had avenged
      on the body of Gavrolles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be <i>a propos</i>, at this point, to allay the reader&rsquo;s curiosity
      as to what took place at Boulogne after Gavrolles fell by Sutherland&rsquo;s
      hand. Of course there was an inquiry and a great scandal&mdash;duels with
      fatal terminations being very unusual in these days. Forster lay at the
      hotel slowly recovering from his wound, under surveillance. Sutherland was
      under arrest for some hours, and was only released on giving substantial
      pledges to appear when called upon. For a time it seemed likely that a
      prosecution of a serious nature would ensue; but money and influence were
      brought to bear on the authorities, and the two Englishmen were eventually
      suffered, whilst the police pretended to &lsquo;look another way,&rsquo; to cross the
      Channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of Gavrolles, Forster seemed to resign himself more and
      more to melancholic prostration; and more than once when his wound was
      slowly healing, he avowed his regret that it was not to have a fatal
      termination. He would sit for days in a sort of mental stupor, scarcely
      looking up when spoken to, seldom or never uttering a word. On his return
      to England, instead of again occupying his house at Kensington, he took
      chambers near Bond Street for himself and his little son, and had the
      family mansion closed. His sister Margaret wished to remain with him, but
      at his strong desire she went away to dwell with some relations in the
      country. To tell the truth, he had not quite forgiven her the want of
      sympathy she had shown for the lost idol of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after his return from Mount Eden, Sutherland found Forster,
      sad, despairing, but convalescent, in his lonely chambers. The two had by
      this time become great friends, or more than friends; and Sutherland was
      welcomed with as bright a smile as the weary face could wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been looking over some old photographs,&rsquo; said Forster presently.
      &lsquo;Strange! how they one and all fail to represent her I have lost. Here is
      one of &ldquo;Imogen.&rdquo; The features are there, but the soul is altogether
      wanting.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sutherland glanced over the pictures, which were lying on a small
      writing-table at Forster&rsquo;s side; then he said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think it wise to open up old wounds in this way? Can you not try
      to forget?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, never!&rsquo; returned Forster, while his eyes filled with tears. &lsquo;My
      only comfort, <i>now</i>, is to think of my darling&mdash;to wait and pray
      until, with God&rsquo;s blessing, we meet again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you bear to speak of her, <i>now</i>?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI.&mdash;HOW MADELINE ROSE AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few days after
      Edgar Sutherland&rsquo;s visit to Mount Eden, Jane Peartree walked out for the
      first time after her illness into the sun. She wore the plain cap and gown
      of the other inmates of the Home, and even in that simple costume (or
      rather, perhaps, because of it) she looked strangely beautiful. Leaning on
      the arm of Adèle Lambert, she passed feebly across the green lawn in front
      of the house, and gained a garden seat in a quiet walk leading to the home
      farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was very mild for winter tide, the sun was shining gently, and
      here and there from the dark earth a snowdrop was peeping. The air,
      moreover, was full of that cool, balmy sweetness which so often in our
      chill climate precedes the resurrection of the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jane Peartree was ill at ease. Ever since her encounter with
      Sutherland she had been strangely fretful and uneasy, and had not her
      strength failed she would certainly have taken her departure before that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they sat together on the window-seat, her cry was still for speedy
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must go to-morrow!&mdash;yes, Adèle, to-morrow! I have already stayed
      too long!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, madame, you are still so weak. Why should you go so soon?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot stay! I have so far to go,&mdash;and&mdash;and I shall go mad, I
      think, if I remain. You are all kind&mdash;kinder than I deserve&mdash;but
      it is not that! No, no!&rsquo; &lsquo;But <i>where</i> will you go, madame? Have you
      not told me you have no home&mdash;no friends?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have none&mdash;I want none,&rsquo; returned Jane Peartree; &lsquo;but all the
      same, I must leave this place. Here, I feel like a dead woman in her
      shroud, dead and cold, but being forced back to life, just when I would be
      left alone to rest for ever. I do not feel at peace. In the night I cannot
      sleep, and in the day I am afraid. Why should I be sitting here in the
      sunshine, when by rights I should be lying in my grave?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adèle looked at her companion in deep sorrow and pain, and wondered,
      indeed, if her wits were going, since her words were so incomprehensible
      and strange. Just then, as they sat side by side, there passed across the
      lawn, some hundred yards away, the figure of a man, at the sight of whom
      Adèle brightened, and said, forcing a smile:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sister Ursula tells me your name is uncommon, even in England; yet you
      have a namesake yonder, madame.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A namesake?&rsquo; repeated Jane Peartree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; one of the gardeners upon the estate. That is he crossing to the
      shrubberies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Peartree turned her weary eyes towards the man, and in a moment her
      heart leapt up in wondering recognition, her pale face flushed, and she
      uttered a low cry. Who that had once seen it could fail to remember the
      little, quaint, old-fashioned figure, the curious gait, of Luke Peartree?
      Yes, it was Uncle Luke, greyer and older than when, long years before, he
      led little Madeline home from Grayfleet Churchyard, but still living&mdash;&lsquo;to
      brighten the sunshine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick! call him! I must speak to him!&rsquo; cried the invalid, rising faintly
      to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adèle ran off instantly after the man, who had disappeared into the
      shrubberies. Presently she reappeared, the little gnome-like figure
      trotting by her side. As he came up, clad in homespun and leather gaiters,
      and carrying a pruning-hook, his wrinkled face expanded into the vacant
      wondering smile that was so familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his surprise to see a strange woman, tall and pale, standing with
      extended arms, gazing upon him through streaming tears?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Luke! don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke stood and scratched his head, smiling, more amicably than ever,
      the smile of honest stupefaction. Before he could utter a word, which,
      indeed, he was in no hurry to do, the strange woman had flung her arms
      around his neck, and, sobbing and crying, was kissing him upon the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Luke! it is I&mdash;Madeline!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man staggered as if under a blow, and went quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madlin!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Not little Madlin as I brung to London! Why, lor&rsquo;, so
      it be!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at a loss for any other means of expressing his utter bewilderment and
      delight, he grinned from ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very pretty it was, as well as pitiful, to see Madeline (whom we shall
      call by her assumed name no longer) lead the little man to the garden
      seat, sit by his side, hold his hand, and look fondly in his eyes, as she
      questioned him, lifting his rough hand to kiss it from time to time. The
      weight of years, the burden of sorrow, had rolled away from her in a
      moment, and she was a child again, while the heaven that &lsquo;bends above us
      in our infancy&rsquo; was opening over her&mdash;bright, tranquil, peaceful, and
      divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, poor Uncle Luke seemed too stupefied to understand completely
      what was taking place. He sat blushing and grinning, scarcely able to
      recognise, in the beautiful, full-grown woman fondling him, the little
      Madlin of his remembrance; and indeed that remembrance was sadly clouded,
      like the rest of his feeble mind, by the mists of years. When she told him
      how diligently and how often she had sought to trace him, when she
      questioned him as to the reasons which had prevented him from seeking her
      out, he had little or no reply to give. She gathered, however, that he had
      been for years in the service of a distant kinsman, who was a head
      gardener on the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was destined to be a day of strange surprises. As Madeline sat by Uncle
      Luke, her face wet with happy tears, two gentlemen approached along the
      garden wall behind her. Adèle saw them first, and was about to utter a
      delighted cry, when the younger of the two placed his finger to his lips
      to enjoin silence. Thus it happened that, before Madeline knew or
      suspected the truth, she saw her husband standing before her, gazing upon
      her with wistful, wondering eyes; and before she could stir or speak she
      beheld him kneeling beside her, sobbing wildly, touching her with his
      outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline! My darling!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose wildly to her feet, looking this way and that, as if in act to
      fly. Uncle Luke rose too, completely puzzled, till Adèle beckoned him
      away. So it came to pass that the other three walked aside, and the
      husband and wife were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madeline! speak to me; my Madeline, my own dear wife!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered at the last word, and made a feeble attempt to withdraw from
      his embrace; but at last, sobbing hysterically, she yielded, and suffered
      him, with tenderest kisses, to place her head upon his breast.

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n that manner, and
      in no other, Madeline rose from the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first shock of meeting was over, and calmer speech was possible,
      Forster told his wife of the duel on Boulogne sands and the death of her
      persecutor at the hands of Edgar Sutherland; thus assuring her that,
      whether the marriage with Gavrolles was real or a delusion, she was then a
      free woman. She listened sadly, and seemed little comforted, until Forster
      assured her of his intention, with her consent, to quit England, and seek
      some country where the story of their sorrows was unknown, and where the
      viperous journal of the period has not yet begun to crawl. Then she again
      laid her head upon his breast, and promised to go with him, anywhere out
      of the old world of scandal, cruelty, and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she lived, who had died. By her own lips the mystery of her
      resurrection was explained. She told him how, while flying in despair, she
      had encountered the poor waif of the streets, and in some wild impulse of
      dread, fearing pursuit, and wishing to destroy all traces of identity, she
      had taken the shawl from her shoulders, bracelets from her wrists, and
      given them to her outcast sister. The rest was clear. Mad with drink and
      misery, the outcast must have yielded to death&rsquo;s fascination, and cast
      herself away into the river&mdash;whence, long afterwards, her disfigured
      body was taken to be identified by Forster and buried, as the reader is
      aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline lived again. She still lives, but far away from the scene of her
      martyrdom. Sometimes in the course of his wanderings (for he is still a
      wanderer and unmarried) Edgar Sutherland visits a pleasant home on the
      bank of a great American river, where a happy wife and husband are growing
      old together among their children. There he is ever an honoured guest,
      certain of having attentive auditors while he discourses, more garrulously
      as years creep on, on his pet theme&mdash;the purification of manhood and
      the regeneration of womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Luke is yonder, too. At Madeline&rsquo;s strong entreaty, he accompanied
      her from England; and now, very old and feeble, but still bright and
      simple as ever, he goes hand in hand through the woods and fields, with
      another &lsquo;little Madlin,&rsquo; the very image of the little girl he used to love
      so well. For a long time he hardly seemed to recognise in the gentle woman
      who took him to her home the pretty Madeline of other years; but when the
      child came, he, a child himself, found his happiness in her, and
      recognised the vision of his old playmate, re-risen to delight his
      declining days.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, what remains to be told? The human shadows that have arisen
      throughout our story fade one by one away. Of only one of these, Adèle
      Lambert, will the reader care to hear a last record. She died in the
      springtime at Mount Eden, passing away, in perfect peace and faith: her
      spirit purified; her hand in that of the man who had pointed her upward to
      a holier life, her eyes on the face she had learned to regard as that of
      an angel, sent to succour sinners in this dark world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world remains as most men find it; a tomb, save for those superb
      spirits who come to bless the wretcheder dwellers in it, with deeds of
      beautiful self-sacrifice and words of divine love. In the depth of its
      darker recesses, still the snake-like seducer slimes his victim, and the
      slanderer spits his venom, and the literature of the Liar still festers
      like a feverish sore, spreading moral sickness and contamination all
      around. Thence, and thence only, comes the voice which would fain proclaim
      to the unhappy that there is no God, and but one gospel&mdash;&lsquo;Eat and
      drink, for tomorrow you die.&rsquo; But God is, as sure as Love is, or Hope, or
      heavenly Purity and Light. Therefore let no man despair, though now, as
      ever, &lsquo;the Light shineth in Darkness, and the Darkness comprehendeth it
      not.&rsquo;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
